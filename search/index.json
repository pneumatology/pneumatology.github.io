[{"content":"Summary I really need to mention the Sword of the Spirit.\nI have experienced the pricked heart many times, and currently right now, and so I need to write about it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Many a minister, some saints, have claimed to be speaking God’s message and are not really uttering His message. Inside them are ‘prickings’ and though they often ignore them, they are truly wounded, for the ‘idle words’ that they spoke are bringing an ‘accounting’, God is pricking their hearts. I\u0026rsquo;m convicted that I sometimes speak without conviction of the Holy Spirit; Please just follow the Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s voice for yourself - it\u0026rsquo;s the most important thing to develop that relationship.\nI am not perfect, and I am still learning! I\u0026rsquo;m new to all of this!\nI say this because as I write and learn I discover new things, remove old beliefs, but I am building my mind maps and belief system dynamically (as I go along), for proof.\n693.

Rather people come to the sacred shrine to learn more about themselves and understand in relation to one another. Neither is it the place for people to desecrate the sacred shrine with their personal biases; Rather, the personal biases can\u0026rsquo;t impact the core values because the core values are inclusive.\nIn preserving the sacred shrine its values should be transforming the desecration zone into the shrine. Also, the shrine needs to be defended from social stigmas infiltrating and becoming social rules, because then they become core values which discriminate, turning the shrine into the desecration zone.\nUpon entering the shrine of core-values a person should feel free to express their personal bias but should bypass the desecration zone to avoid creating false witness.\nDiagram of dysfunction or desecration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 See diagram of corruption | \\ Corrupted | _\\| Uncorrupted | _______________________________________ Testimony - (e.g. people are more than machines) _________________ \\|/ / Desecration zone \\ | _________________ | | | | | | | | Personal bias ------------\u0026gt; gossip, false witness, marks | +-- Personal bias | | | | ____________ ______________ | / | | | Believes gossip\u0026lt;-------- | | | | | / | | | Believes rules.\u0026lt;----------- Worldy social rules, | | / | | | Looks for God | | | core values reflect \u0026lt;-+---------+/ | | | but can\u0026#39;t see | | | wordly morals. | | | No enrichment.| | any evidence. | | | No acknowledgement -------------------\u0026gt; | | Doesn\u0026#39;t yet | | |_ of personal truth. _| | | Persecution. | | understand own | | _ Identity is a label. _ | | | | Identity. | | | Placing people in boxes.| | | | | | | | Sees people as machines.| | | Relationship | | Idealised | | | Judging eachother on |\\\\\\|||///| | with God | | society \u0026lt;--------| | attributes. |-Social -| | under strain | | doesn\u0026#39;t exist. | | | False teachers. |-stimgas-| | | | It\u0026#39;s just the | | | False shrine. | |///|||\\\\\\| | | | same. | | |_________| |______|________| | | Temple of | | Feeling lost. | | | \u0026lt;\u0026lt; | Identity | | No identity. \u0026lt;~~~~~~~~~ - labels | \u0026lt;\u0026lt; | | |________________| | |____^^________________|__________________| |________________| | ^^ | | worldly Adopted a value system based on the desecration zone, | morals testimony misattributed to something like \u0026#39;conspiracy theory\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;immoral\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;demonic\u0026#39;. | Self-stigma (non-ideal mode of transmission) Within the false shrine, people are placed into boxes. Conversation is shallow. Personal truth is never acknowledged, and often discredited as insanity, conspiracy theory, heresy or sinister - as if there is always an evil motive behind a divergence. People are excluded or marked on the basis of superficial attributes such as culture, gender, race, socioeconomic class, age, sexual orientation, body image, intelligence or lack thereof, and health, etc. marks or labels. People are labelled as a way to coerce people into believing a false identity. Things beyond the physical are never talked about, as that relates to personal truth. Unconditional love is a personal truth, so it is rebuked. Lots of social fear.\nFragile social morality and artificial intelligence There will be an exacerbation of the problem of identity due to artificial intelligence.\nWhether you believe it or not, we are heading into an artificially generated fictional reality based on artificial imagination. The consequences of this is that the fragile and fake moral system will be completely gone. Don\u0026rsquo;t trust it for your truth or your morals. It\u0026rsquo;s best to use the time right now to find your identity and establish your truth compass.\nIdentity Through Heaven\u0026rsquo;s Eyes - YouTube\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A single thread in a tapestry, though it\u0026#39;s colour brightly shine, can never see its purpose in the pattern of the grand design. And the stone that sits on the very top of the mountain\u0026#39;s mighty face, does it think it\u0026#39;s more important than the stones that form the base? So how can you see what your life is worth or where your value lies? You can never see through the eyes of man. You must look at your life, look at your life through heaven\u0026#39;s eyes. Once again, people are more than machines and people\u0026rsquo;s have a uniqueness beyond stereotypes, stigmas, labels etc. no matter how much offence it causes other people. Their identity is a unique part of the tapestry with a unique purpose.\nSo rather than discourage uniqueness, uniqueness should be celebrated, even when it\u0026rsquo;s offensive. Uniqueness in character, age, financial/geographical situation, personal history, gender identity, deformities, etc. One person\u0026rsquo;s fiction is another person\u0026rsquo;s truth, but no-one will ever see objective truth and find common ground, nor be able to discern truth from lies unless people first understand their personal truth and identity.\nDiscovering uniqueness is discovering truth.\n1 Corinthians 13:6 Love does not delight in iniquity but rejoices with the truth. The absence of love delights in discrimination and delights when the truth is concealed; Delights when people\u0026rsquo;s true identity is suffocated.\nSome people are daydreamers, imagineers so what is truth for them? It\u0026rsquo;s not as simple as scientific fact/fiction. The measurement instrument is the person\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience, not a gyroscope.\nThing\u0026rsquo;s like gender identity, age identity, ethnic identity, etc. are true to the person. It\u0026rsquo;s not their fault they are the way they are, but their nature. But those personal truths are only the starting point of identity. Reality of identity is sacred - that part of reality isn\u0026rsquo;t up for debate; The whole experience of life is based on that foundation. The objective should first be to understand that.\nThe problem with discrimination is it keeps people questioning the perceived attributes, beliefs system, and validity of their identity, and not focused on more important things such as ideas, hopes, dreams etc. which constitutes 99% of the person and is the true emanation of a person\u0026rsquo;s soul after a person has bypassed the blanket of insecurity; The important \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; stuff after you sort out identity, the things that differentiate between human and grass.\nPlace in society So the problem is this: People make low-level judgements about people on their perceived attributes. The attention is on the stupid stuff which is the outwards perception of 1% of a person and is unchangeable. Labels are not even true as their identity is different. People don\u0026rsquo;t accept themselves so they can\u0026rsquo;t accept God.\nIdeas, hopes, dreams aren\u0026rsquo;t talked about. The full diversity of relationships and viewpoints, and progress beyond the normal are not allowed to exist.\nSimple things like communication need to be upheld and kept above the swamp of stupidity (attacking personal identity, and casting labels), and institutions which discriminate should be dismantled.\nA person is born into this world as a seed and grows into their fullness. They choose what they want to be \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s what the subject of discussion should be, and try to nurture that. This gives hope and a reason to live for the person, rather than making people conform to social norms. Why teach ignorance and self- degredation?\nMy frustration are institutions which allow social rules and institutional rules (structural stigmas) to keep people at level 1 and stop them from living up to their potential.\nA mature adult isn\u0026rsquo;t their perceived attributes anymore and neither should a young person be taught that they are.\nThe sacred shrine should be a place without division or discrimination. People should feel safe to be themselves and people should be taught to see others the way Heaven does. The sacred shrine should despise discrimination just as God does, never separate people, never embed false witness by asserting the universal truth of social rules, and encourage socialisation. Dismantle itself before it dismantles unity.\nThe fruits of that are so good:\nis fewer communication problems better conversation people finding their place building confidence people coming to identity in Christ A person\u0026rsquo;s place in such a society is the place of a first-class citizen with no passport. And I\u0026rsquo;m not even talking about a Vaccine Passport. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about partaking in any part of the community without discrimination or prejudice.\nI recognise this is idealised but judgement should not be cast without precedent and discernment. NEVER use labels. Stand up to all forms of discrimination when you see it. Don\u0026rsquo;t allow segregation to continue. Dismantle exclusionary rules.\nWhy have I written this article? Because it\u0026rsquo;s not worth throwing my life away by continuing to accept lies, either when it\u0026rsquo;s happening within my visible range, or internally.\n2 Peter 2 I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be here 1 2 3 4 5 20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. What is the likeness of Christ we are supposed to transform to? The likeness of Christ isn\u0026rsquo;t destroying your personal uniqueness. It\u0026rsquo;s becoming someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t spread false witness, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t discriminate, etc. Christ didn\u0026rsquo;t discriminate. Christ actively broke down walls that discriminate etc. It\u0026rsquo;s a person becoming confident in their identity, and treating others the same way.\nThe reason for the 8th commandment To protect souls so they can be saved in their originality, and so people can obtain discernment. The commandment is literally for people\u0026rsquo;s protection and to allow them to find God and help eachother. Discrimination is manslaughter against people\u0026rsquo;s souls. Do not discriminate! Of all the commandments I think this one is the most important, yet the most overlooked.\nMark 12:30-31 You could say \u0026lsquo;do not discriminate\u0026rsquo; is part of the greatest commandment according to Jesus. 1 2 3 4 5 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.” What does Jesus mean by solid ground? He\u0026rsquo;s talking about base truth or personal truth This means build the foundation of personal truth, which the belief system sits upon. The portion of Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit given to you integrates itself into your base truth.\nLinks https://www.goodshepherdwayland.org/documents/racism-is-breaking-the-8th-commandment More importantly, how to come to Christ This describes what a person\u0026rsquo;s spirit is (deeper than soul).

Absolutely not!(AJ) For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.(AK) 22 But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin,(AL) so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.

Vedhaantha is monistic (Adhvaitha). The essence of Vedhaantha is the triune unity of thought, word and deed. In this unity, true bliss can be experienced. It will also demonstrate the spiritual basis of divinity. All study of Vedhaantha is of no avail if the precepts are not practised. Interesting and overlapping concepts to me!\nHowever, the Holy Spirit and hearing God\u0026rsquo;s voice is about more than mere bliss!\nThe Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s voice and this Living Water, truly feels like an internal spring, and blazing fire in your heart and body when you follow and obey.\nChristian baptism and the heart Water baptism - dedication to the obedience of divine precepts, from the heart, and the unity of inner and outer truth aligns your heart to God, so that you can see God.

Gospel of Thomas Saying 13 1 2 3 4 Jesus says: \u0026#34;I am no longer thy master; for thou hast drunk, thou art inebriated from the bubbling spring which is mine and which I sent forth. Know the truth, and pass it on. Teach others! Show others how to find it, with the method you found. The spring is real.\nJohn 10:27-28 1 2 3 4 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. Jesus gives us eternal life. This is the wellspring of truth bubbling up in our hearts. First, we must know the truth.\nJohn 5:24 1 2 3 4 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. John 14:6 1 2 3 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. You\u0026rsquo;re allowed to think of the person you love, even if they\u0026rsquo;re cut off from you.

Book of Thomas the Contender (Jude Thomas, missionary to India) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 To the fool, however, the good and bad are the same - indeed the wise man will be nourished by the truth and (Ps. 1:3) \u0026#34;will be like a tree growing by the meandering stream\u0026#34; - seeing that there are some who, although having wings, rush upon the visible things, things that are far from the truth. This speaks against to belief systems which do not believe in good and evil.\nWhile being led by the Spirit of Truth it\u0026rsquo;s possible to get vision/resolution to notice it more easily.\nJohn 4:4–26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 But he had to go through Samaria. So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob\u0026#39;s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon. A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Give me a drink.\u0026#34; (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, \u0026#34;How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?\u0026#34; (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, \u0026#34;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, \u0026#39;Give me a drink\u0026#39;, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Go, call your husband, and come back.\u0026#34; The woman answered him, \u0026#34;I have no husband.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;You are right in saying, \u0026#39;I have no husband\u0026#39;; for you have had five husbands, and the man you are now living with is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;I know that Messiah is coming\u0026#34; (who is called Christ). \u0026#34;When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;I am he, the one who is speaking to you.\u0026#34; The Odes of Solomon (first or second century AD) He has filled me with words of truth, that I may proclaim Him. And like the flowing of waters, truth flows from my mouth, and my lips declare His fruits. Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, who have been entrusted with His water. Even living persons who were about to expire, they have held back from death. Because everyone recognized them as the Lord\u0026rsquo;s, and lived by the living water of eternity. From the beginning until the end I received His knowledge. And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me. And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord generously. And so I drank and became intoxicated, from the living water that does not die. And my intoxication did not cause ignorance, but I abandoned vanity. I rejected the folly cast upon the earth. As a fountain gushes forth its water, so my heart gushes forth the praise of the Lord, and my lips bring forth praise to Him. His possessions are immortal life, and those who receive it are incorruptible.\n13\n1 2 3 4 1 Behold, the Lord is our mirror. Open your eyes and see them in Him. 2 And learn the manner of your face, then declare praises to His Spirit. 3 And wipe the paint from your face, and love His holiness and put it on. 4 Then you will be unblemished at all times with Him. This is so true. The perfect identity. The divine scales of spiritual truth.\nSee The Tapestry of Truth // Bodacious Blog.\n30\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 Fill for yourselves water from the living fountain of the Lord, because it has been opened for you. 2 And come all you thirsty and take a drink, and rest beside the fountain of the Lord. 3 Because it is pleasing and sparkling, and perpetually refreshes the self. 4 For much sweeter is its water than honey, and the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it; 5 Because it flowed from the lips of the Lord, and it named from the heart of the Lord. 6 And it came boundless and invisible, and until it was set in the middle they knew it not. 7 Blessed are they who have drunk from it, and have refreshed themselves by it. Hallelujah. John 14:16-30 ERV 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper to be with you forever. The Helper is the Spirit of truth. The people of the world cannot accept him, because they don’t see him or know him. But you know him. He lives with you, and he will be in you. “I will not leave you all alone like orphans. I will come back to you. In a very short time the people in the world will not see me anymore. But you will see me. You will live because I live. On that day you will know that I am in the Father. You will know that you are in me and I am in you. Those who really love me are the ones who not only know my commands but also obey them. My Father will love such people, and I will love them. I will make myself known to them.” Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, how will you make yourself known to us, but not to the world?” Jesus answered, “All who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them. My Father and I will come to them and live with them. But anyone who does not love me does not obey my teaching. This teaching that you hear is not really mine. It is from my Father who sent me. “I have told you all these things while I am with you. But the Helper will teach you everything and cause you to remember all that I told you. This Helper is the Holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name. “I leave you peace. It is my own peace I give you. I give you peace in a different way than the world does. So don’t be troubled. Don’t be afraid. You heard me say to you, ‘I am leaving, but I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be happy that I am going back to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. I have told you this now, before it happens. Then when it happens, you will believe. “I will not talk with you much longer. The ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me. Thomas 17 1 2 3 4 Jesus said: I will give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has not entered into the heart of man. Ezekiel 36:26-27 1 2 3 4 5 6 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 2 Timothy 2:15 1 2 3 4 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. 1 John 3:18 The truth must be in you, and you must live out the truth\n1 2 18 Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth. 1 John 1:5–10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us. Ode 9 1 2 And also that those who have known Him may not perish, and so that those who received Him may not be ashamed. An everlasting crown is Truth; blessed are they who set it on their head. By grace we can have a truthful heart and spirit, and not be ashamed.\nOde 24 1 2 3 4 5 And the Lord destroyed the devices, of all those who had not the truth with them. For they were lacking in wisdom, they who exalted themselves in their mind. So they were rejected, because the truth was not with them. For the Lord revealed His way, and spread widely His grace. And those who understood it knew His holiness. Some people exalt themselves, thinking themselves fortunate to have born into the right body to be saved. Fools. The body and the outwards appearance doesn\u0026rsquo;t save. It will be harder for them to make their heart truthful.\n1 Corinthians 15:50 KJV Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. This is not just pretty language, it\u0026rsquo;s the truth.\nOde 6 1 2 3 4 5 For there went forth a stream, and it became a river great and broad; indeed it carried away everything, and it shattered and brought it to the Temple. And the barriers which were built by men were not able to restrain it, nor even the arts of them who habitually restrain water. For it spread over the surface of all the earth, and it filled everything. Then all the thirsty upon the earth drank, and thirst was relieved and quenched; For from the Most High the drink was given. Psalm 34:8 1 2 Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him. So turn your face to God (by becoming Truthful), and drink!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 praxis Key in meditation and spirituality, where emphasis is placed on gaining first-hand experience of concepts and certain areas, such as union with the Divine, which can only be explored through praxis due to the inability of the finite mind (and its tool, language) to comprehend or express the infinite. Wisdom is always taste (in both Latin and Hebrew), the word for wisdom comes from the word for taste. Wisdom is something to taste, not something to theorize about. The personal cistern I believe that at the heart of a person, God is seen differently by different people, as in seeing different facets of the same God. The cistern is your personal source of truth and joy.\nProverbs 5 Lest thou give thine honour unto others Do not let thieves trick you into giving them your honour. Similar to \u0026lsquo;do not throw your pearls before swine\u0026rsquo;. If you are faithful to someone then hold onto that; It\u0026rsquo;s not just a gift. A person builds their life on their honour which is their personal truth which involves true love. When a person\u0026rsquo;s honour is given to those who are undeserving (i.e themselves faithless), it damages that person\u0026rsquo;s foundation of their life, setting them back to square 1.\nTo build something great, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a relationship, or a project, a belief system, or even knowledge itself, in order to advance and build something elaborate, the foundations of knowledge, and a person\u0026rsquo;s true belief in it must be strong. Removing honour and self-worth erodes the foundation of a person. I live by this; In job, career, love and my knowledge, I build upwards.\nThe treasure you save for the right person, or to God.\nOthers (normal people; faithless), who\u0026rsquo;s hearts are themselves full of adultery, trick you into giving up and relinquishing this treasure.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. 17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers\u0026#39; with thee. 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings. 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. More importantly than mere marriage, I believe the cistern represents the truth of your source of truth and joy. At all times be faithful to it. Your personal truth is not for other people to trample over and rewrite. Do not share with others in this way. And no matter what, with what spring of truth is given to you, you must drink from this cistern and not other people\u0026rsquo;s. To drink from another\u0026rsquo;s cistern is to corrupt yourself. From a marriage standpoint, your wife is your cistern. Generally, the idea of self-integrity (faithfulness to yourself) and integrity of word (and persona), and unto God is still relevant.\nThe Personal Cistern and the Living Spring The personal cistern is the source of a person\u0026rsquo;s truth and joy. This is where the Living Spring is planted.\nTo upgrade the cistern, you must make yourself into spiritual truth, and retain it through the Holy Spirit The Tapestry of Truth Knowing who God is I think that putting on immortality is like making your heart pure and \u0026lsquo;seeing God\u0026rsquo;.\nThese passages allude to that idea:\n1 Corinthians 15:53 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Corinthians 15:34 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. The Next Level: Spiritual Understanding - Soul-bonding with Christ 1 Corinthians 2:14 Only those aided by God\u0026rsquo;s Holy Spirit have the capacity to understand spiritual things, including God\u0026rsquo;s plan of salvation through faith in the crucified Christ. This is a step beyond becoming truthful! You must at this point:\nconfess that the God of Spiritual Truth and Agape Love is your Father confess Jesus is your Saviour confess that the Holy Spirit is your Councilor ask for Jesus to enter into your heart! ask for the Holy Spirit to enter into your heart! After that, the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom are revealed to you over time, only a few weeks for me!\nGospel of Thomas (28) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight; for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent.\u0026rdquo; Consider that this is with the intention of making our own spirits truthful, so we can see God and receive eternal life.\nFirstly, we \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; God by \u0026lsquo;understanding\u0026rsquo; what spiritual truth is, and God as being the ideal form of it! Like a perfect triangle or ideal form (Plato). Secondly, we may get a chance to \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; God by meeting Him in the Bridal Chamber!\nThrough faith we can become spiritually true, acceptable to God, but that this depends on grace through Jesus.\nThough we are now truthful with dependency on grace, and we maintain it with the spirit of Jesus inside of us!\nTruth and Love are two sides of the same coin. It is an act of love to God to abide in His divine law; To love one another, and to love God (truth).\nRomans 13:8-10 ESV Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Those not helped by God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit simply cannot comprehend spiritual truth. They can grasp things intellectually (Romans 1:18–23; James 2:19), but that does not mean they can attain spiritual understanding. They don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity to understand or believe anything beyond the material world (Isaiah 55:8–9).\nFaithfulness is a very true type of love.\n","date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00+12:00","permalink":"https://pneumatology.github.io/p/living-water-of-truth/","title":"Living Water of Truth"}]
