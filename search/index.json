[{"content":"God is Truth \u0026ndash; of the spiritual type. If your heart is True and pure then you can see God, you are a child of God and you are an eternal spirit.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve seen God with spiritual eyes, a spring of living water is planted in the soul, gushing up to eternal life. A person can\u0026rsquo;t forget this experience because a new standard is set for what is absolutely True; They have glimpsed who and what God is. How do you know? You must become truth.\nProverbs 4:23 מִֽכָּל־ mik-kāl With all מִ֭שְׁמָר miš-mār diligence נְצֹ֣ר nə-ṣōr keep לִבֶּ֑ךָ lib-be-ḵā; your heart כִּֽי־ kî- for מִ֝מֶּ֗נּוּ mim-men-nū, out of it תּוֹצְא֥וֹת tō-wṣ-’ō-wṯ [spring] the issues חַיִּֽים׃ ḥay-yîm. of life. Some feelings of the spirit-self Our spirit is our own truth compass.\nThe burning away of soul People or circumstances forcing you, in this moment, to live a lie When you\u0026rsquo;re left to burn away time When you are in the wrong place When pressured into being somewhere you\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to be, and can\u0026rsquo;t do what\u0026rsquo;s best for yourself without persecution The feeling of not being able to talk to the one you love Every second in the wrong place feels like your life force is being consumed and burning away A full heart You found the courage to voice your truth You\u0026rsquo;re where you want to be, having done what you needed to do You feel loved, though to identify where this love originates, no rational minded person could explain. You feel loved by God when you are able to do that which is your truth. This is the initial evidence that personal truth exists It is evidence that God exists that your true love exists, and can be lived out This is the peace and love of God The candle in your heart Piercing like a flame A spring bubbling with truth, with assurance A never ending power-cell in your heart It makes you laugh when you notice it Anticipation of heaven More than you need Extinguishes the hellfire. Your soul feels rest Compelling you to share your happiness The Water of Life flows from the throne of God It will keep you from dying It has the power to save others Water of Life (Eternal Truth)\nWhite is associated with truth, purity, cleansing, healing and protection. It is a good general healing color for the removal of pain and suffering. In the aura it signifies a high level of attainment, a higher level soul incarnate to help others.\nWater on white is the depiction of the Water of Life.\nCarl Jung (1913) A truth is a truth, when it works. That is how we know the truth: the truth is that which helps us to live – to live properly. Vedhaantha - Hinduism The teachings of Sri Sathya Sai (Indian guru) point to integrity bringing forth bliss, truth and joy. In this I can relate. To have this a person must walk in their truth and external actions must reflect the inside.\nhttps://mullikine.github.io/posts/living-water/\nTeachings of Sri Sathya Sai:\nhttps://www.sathyasai.org/ https://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume14/sss14-34.pdf https://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume15/sss15-35.pdf Every man should strive to achieve unity in thought, word and deed.\nThis profound truth is proclaimed by the Vedhaanthik pronouncement that the body is a temple in which the eternal Aathma is the Indweller.\n\u0026ldquo;Manas-anyath, vachas-anyath, karmanya-anyath dhuraathmanaam\u0026rdquo; The wicked are those whose thoughts deviate from their words and actions. The Veda is dualistic. Vedhaantha is monistic (Adhvaitha).\nThe essence of Vedhaantha is the triune unity of thought, word and deed. In this unity, true bliss can be experienced.\nIt will also demonstrate the spiritual basis of divinity.\nAll study of Vedhaantha is of no avail if the precepts are not practised.\nIn Christian terms Water baptism - dedication to the obedience of divine precepts, from the heart, and the unity of inner and outer truth aligns your heart to God, so that you can see God. Bliss comes from this.\nThe Living Spring - Scriptures Revelation 22 - Eden is Restored 1 2 3 22 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb Gospel of Thomas Saying 108 1 2 (108) Jesus said: He who drinks from my mouth will become like me, and I will become like him, and the hidden things will be revealed to him. Gospel of Thomas Saying 13 1 2 3 4 Jesus says: \u0026#34;I am no longer thy master; for thou hast drunk, thou art inebriated from the bubbling spring which is mine and which I sent forth. Know the truth, and pass it on. Teach others! Show others how to find it, with the method you found. The spring is real.\nJohn 10:27-28 1 2 3 4 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. Jesus gives us eternal life. This is the wellspring of truth bubbling up in our hearts. First, we must know the truth.\nJohn 5:24 1 2 3 4 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. John 14:6 1 2 3 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Jeremiah 2:13–19 1 2 3 “‘They have forsaken me, the spring of living water.’ … declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.” Philippians 4:8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. You\u0026rsquo;re allowed to think of the person you love, even if they\u0026rsquo;re cut off from you. When you\u0026rsquo;re being true, your soul finds rest.\nOde 12 1 2 For the dwelling place of the Word is man, and His truth is love. Blessed are they who by means of Him have perceived everything, and have known the Lord in His truth. John 4:4–26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 But he had to go through Samaria. So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob\u0026#39;s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon. A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Give me a drink.\u0026#34; (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, \u0026#34;How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?\u0026#34; (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, \u0026#34;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, \u0026#39;Give me a drink\u0026#39;, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Go, call your husband, and come back.\u0026#34; The woman answered him, \u0026#34;I have no husband.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;You are right in saying, \u0026#39;I have no husband\u0026#39;; for you have had five husbands, and the man you are now living with is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;I know that Messiah is coming\u0026#34; (who is called Christ). \u0026#34;When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;I am he, the one who is speaking to you.\u0026#34; The Odes of Solomon (first or second century AD) He has filled me with words of truth, that I may proclaim Him. And like the flowing of waters, truth flows from my mouth, and my lips declare His fruits. Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, who have been entrusted with His water. Even living persons who were about to expire, they have held back from death. Because everyone recognized them as the Lord\u0026rsquo;s, and lived by the living water of eternity. From the beginning until the end I received His knowledge. And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me. And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord generously. And so I drank and became intoxicated, from the living water that does not die. And my intoxication did not cause ignorance, but I abandoned vanity. I rejected the folly cast upon the earth. As a fountain gushes forth its water, so my heart gushes forth the praise of the Lord, and my lips bring forth praise to Him. His possessions are immortal life, and those who receive it are incorruptible.\n13\n1 2 3 4 1 Behold, the Lord is our mirror. Open your eyes and see them in Him. 2 And learn the manner of your face, then declare praises to His Spirit. 3 And wipe the paint from your face, and love His holiness and put it on. 4 Then you will be unblemished at all times with Him. This is so true. The perfect identity. The divine scales of spiritual truth.\nSee The Tapestry of Truth // Bodacious Blog.\n30\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 Fill for yourselves water from the living fountain of the Lord, because it has been opened for you. 2 And come all you thirsty and take a drink, and rest beside the fountain of the Lord. 3 Because it is pleasing and sparkling, and perpetually refreshes the self. 4 For much sweeter is its water than honey, and the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it; 5 Because it flowed from the lips of the Lord, and it named from the heart of the Lord. 6 And it came boundless and invisible, and until it was set in the middle they knew it not. 7 Blessed are they who have drunk from it, and have refreshed themselves by it. Hallelujah. John 14:16-30 ERV 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper to be with you forever. The Helper is the Spirit of truth. The people of the world cannot accept him, because they don’t see him or know him. But you know him. He lives with you, and he will be in you. “I will not leave you all alone like orphans. I will come back to you. In a very short time the people in the world will not see me anymore. But you will see me. You will live because I live. On that day you will know that I am in the Father. You will know that you are in me and I am in you. Those who really love me are the ones who not only know my commands but also obey them. My Father will love such people, and I will love them. I will make myself known to them.” Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, how will you make yourself known to us, but not to the world?” Jesus answered, “All who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them. My Father and I will come to them and live with them. But anyone who does not love me does not obey my teaching. This teaching that you hear is not really mine. It is from my Father who sent me. “I have told you all these things while I am with you. But the Helper will teach you everything and cause you to remember all that I told you. This Helper is the Holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name. “I leave you peace. It is my own peace I give you. I give you peace in a different way than the world does. So don’t be troubled. Don’t be afraid. You heard me say to you, ‘I am leaving, but I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be happy that I am going back to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. I have told you this now, before it happens. Then when it happens, you will believe. “I will not talk with you much longer. The ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me. Thomas 17 1 2 3 4 Jesus said: I will give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has not entered into the heart of man. Ezekiel 36:26-27 1 2 3 4 5 6 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 2 Timothy 2:15 1 2 3 4 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. 1 John 3:18 The truth must be in you, and you must live out the truth\n1 2 18 Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth. 1 John 1:5–10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us. Ode 9 1 2 And also that those who have known Him may not perish, and so that those who received Him may not be ashamed. An everlasting crown is Truth; blessed are they who set it on their head. By grace we can have a truthful heart and spirit, and not be ashamed.\nOde 24 1 2 3 4 5 And the Lord destroyed the devices, of all those who had not the truth with them. For they were lacking in wisdom, they who exalted themselves in their mind. So they were rejected, because the truth was not with them. For the Lord revealed His way, and spread widely His grace. And those who understood it knew His holiness. Some people exalt themselves, thinking themselves fortunate to have born into the right body to be saved. Fools. The body and the outwards appearance doesn\u0026rsquo;t save. It will be harder for them to make their heart truthful.\nOde 6 1 2 3 4 5 For there went forth a stream, and it became a river great and broad; indeed it carried away everything, and it shattered and brought it to the Temple. And the barriers which were built by men were not able to restrain it, nor even the arts of them who habitually restrain water. For it spread over the surface of all the earth, and it filled everything. Then all the thirsty upon the earth drank, and thirst was relieved and quenched; For from the Most High the drink was given. The personal cistern I believe that at the heart of a person, God is seen differently by different people, as in seeing different facets of the same God. The cistern is your personal source of truth and joy.\nProverbs 5 Lest thou give thine honour unto others Do not let thieves trick you into giving them your honour. Similar to \u0026lsquo;do not throw your pearls before swine\u0026rsquo;. If you are faithful to someone then hold onto that; It\u0026rsquo;s not just a gift. A person builds their life on their honour which is their personal truth which involves true love. When a person\u0026rsquo;s honour is given to those who are undeserving (i.e themselves faithless), it damages that person\u0026rsquo;s foundation of their life, setting them back to square 1.\nTo build something great, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a relationship, or a project, a belief system, or even knowledge itself, in order to advance and build something elaborate, the foundations of knowledge, and a person\u0026rsquo;s true belief in it must be strong. Removing honour and self-worth erodes the foundation of a person. I live by this; In job, career, love and my knowledge, I build upwards.\nThe treasure you save for the right person, or to God.\nOthers (normal people; faithless), who\u0026rsquo;s hearts are themselves full of adultery, trick you into giving up and relinquishing this treasure.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. 17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers\u0026#39; with thee. 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings. 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. More importantly than mere marriage, I believe the cistern represents the truth of your source of truth and joy. At all times be faithful to it. Your personal truth is not for other people to trample over and rewrite. Do not share with others in this way. And no matter what, with what spring of truth is given to you, you must drink from this cistern and not other people\u0026rsquo;s. To drink from another\u0026rsquo;s cistern is to corrupt yourself. From a marriage standpoint, your wife is your cistern. Generally, the idea of self-integrity (faithfulness to yourself) and integrity of word (and persona), and unto God is still relevant.\nThe Personal Cistern and the Living Spring The personal cistern is the source of a person\u0026rsquo;s truth and joy. This is where the Living Spring is planted.\nTo upgrade the cistern, you must make yourself into spiritual truth The Tapestry of Truth Appendix I think that putting on immortality is like making your heart pure and \u0026lsquo;seeing God\u0026rsquo;.\nThese passages allude to that idea:\n1 Corinthians 15:53 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Corinthians 15:34 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. Spiritual understanding - Christianity Only those aided by God\u0026rsquo;s Holy Spirit have the capacity to understand spiritual things, including God\u0026rsquo;s plan of salvation through faith in the crucified Christ (1 Corinthians 2:14).\nGospel of Thomas (28) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight; for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent.\u0026rdquo; Consider that this is with the intention of making our own spirits truthful, so we can see God and receive eternal life.\nThrough faith we can become spiritually true, acceptable to God, but that this depends on grace through Jesus.\nThough we are now truthful with dependency on grace. Truth and Love are two sides of the same coin. It is an act of love to God to abide in His divine law; To love one another, and to love God (truth).\nRomans 13:8-10 ESV Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Those not helped by God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit simply cannot comprehend spiritual truth. They can grasp things intellectually (Romans 1:18–23; James 2:19), but that does not mean they can attain spiritual understanding. They don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity to understand or believe anything beyond the material world (Isaiah 55:8–9).\nFaithfulness is a very true type of love.\n","date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00+12:00","permalink":"https://pneumatology.github.io/p/living-water-of-truth/","title":"Living Water of Truth"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.\nHeadings The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
