[{"content":" 1 2 3 gospel good news A gift from God. The Gospel is the news which Christianity announces and that is the proclamation of the forgiveness of sins and fellowship with God restored through Christ.\nIt means remission of sins and reconciliation with God through Christ\u0026rsquo;s death by crucifixion.\nThe Gospel of the Grace of God The Gospel of the Kingdom The Gospel of Christ The Gospel of Peace The Glorious Gospel The Eternal Gospel The Gospel of Salvation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. 13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. Sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.\nLuke 5 30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 32I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. The Gospel (good news) of Jesus John 3:17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Colossians 1:14 13 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, 14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man bbelieveth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 The word gospel means “good news,” so the gospel of Christ is the good news of His coming to provide forgiveness of sins for all who will believe (Colossians 1:14; Romans 10:9). Since the first man’s sin, mankind has been under the condemnation of God (Romans 5:12). Because everyone breaks God’s perfect law by committing sin, everyone is guilty (Romans 3:23). The punishment for the crime of sin is physical death (Romans 6:23) and then an eternity spent in a place of punishment (Revelation 20:15; Matthew 25:46). This eternal separation from God is also called the “second death” (Revelation 20:14–15). The bad news that all are guilty of sin and condemned by God is countered by the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ. God, because of His love for the world, has made a way for man to be forgiven of their sins (John 3:16). He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take the sins of mankind on Himself through death on a cross (1 Peter 2:24). In placing our sin on Christ, God ensured that all who will believe in the name of Jesus will be forgiven (Acts 10:43). Jesus’ resurrection guarantees the justification of all who believe (Romans 4:25). See Tapestry of Truth The Tapestry of Truth // Bodacious Blog Spiritual circumcision Spiritually, this is a bit like removing the spiritual corruption/gangrene so your spirit can be knitted with the body of Christ.\nSouls may be knit together through love.\n1 Samuel 18:1 18 As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. Thomas 25 (25) Jesus said: Love your brother as your soul; watch over him like the apple of your eye. Christian brothers and sisters have their souls knitted together.\nColossians 2:2, KJV That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; But before your soul can be knitted with Jesus\u0026rsquo; soul, you must prepare your heart and spiritual identity.\nThis is a 2-stage process:\nBaptism of water Baptism of spirit Baptism of water https://www.christianity.com/wiki/christian-life/what-does-living-water-mean-in-the-bible.html 1 2 3 4 John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit. You can use the 10 commandments to clean your spirit - they\u0026rsquo;re the actions of the heart. For example, mixing is an action when cooking.\nIf you do the actions with the heart you will clean your heart. And you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to notice God; Having swept your house, you become eligible to have the guest live inside (The Holy Spirit).\nThe 10 commandments point to an impossible standard which people need a sacrifice for to be forgiven of transgressions, since we are not perfect, until we are perfected with Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit knit with our own.\nBaptism of repentance Frustratingly, the way the gospel (good news) is presented in the modern-day is usually in such a way that it first condemns to make you feel guilty about things which you innocently do, and feels arbitrary, then to say you can be forgiven and be guilt-free if you only believe in Jesus for forgiveness. This simulation of guilt and then forgiveness is a bit like a \u0026lsquo;baptism\u0026rsquo; (submersion and emersion), but I would say this not a complete way to baptise.\nThe Jews who John the baptist preached to would\u0026rsquo;ve already been aware of the 10 commandments, and that is the difference - this part cannot be skipped.\nRepentance is obedient following of commandments. Baptism of water is a declaration that a person will repent. When a person repents, they learn of God\u0026rsquo;s character and what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be Jesus when they are persecuted.\nThis puts the person into a primed position to be baptised by the Holy Spirit.\nThomas Saying 69 (69) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed are they who have been persecuted within themselves. It is they who have truly come to know the father. Blessed are the hungry, for the belly of him who desires will be filled.\u0026rdquo; In my theory, rather than merely telling someone they are guilty, they must first learn to walk in the commandments to learn who God is from experience. A person must learn who God the Father is and who the Son is, by way of emulation of their character, through their words and commands. This makes the understanding deeply rooted, not merely of understanding of unattainable spiritual perfection, but to understand at which point of being persecuted what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be Jesus.\n1 John 2:3-6 Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, \u0026ldquo;I know Him,\u0026rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. The experience is different for different people; This is like submersion and re-emersion in that it\u0026rsquo;s a rite of passage.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think a water baptism is strictly necessary but I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that the actions of the heart are, which the ceremony is supposed to set into motion. The knowledge of God\u0026rsquo;s character is important to understand before an encounter with Jesus. The mere idea of God\u0026rsquo;s character of but the personal experience of it in relation to you.\nJohn the baptist came to prepare the way for the Lord Jesus.\nMark 1:1-9\n1 2 3 4 5 “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”[c]— “a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” In summary, the rite of passage which water baptism represents is needed in order to be born again of spirit, I think.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a two-stage process. The end result is being born of God (the Christian God).\n","date":"2022-07-13T00:00:00+12:00","permalink":"https://pneumatology.github.io/p/the-glorious-gospel/","title":"The Glorious Gospel"},{"content":"Today Today I woke up and had a vision of my angel trumpet. It started like this:\nFirst there was a flash of white light A second later there was another flash, but this time of my trumpet The trumpet does not belong to me, but belongs to the holy angel which I am united with through the Bridal Chamber - that may be Jesus Himself, but I do not know - all I know is the Holy Spirit is inside me. I may be united with an angel of the Saviour (see bottom); I have to learn more about this. Now the term angel of God has sometimes been used. Simply, I\u0026rsquo;m soul-bonded with God. I do not know the precise details.\nThe electrician was coming over today and needed to do some work in my room. My floor was absolutely covered with rubbish, my clothes etc. just like in the Gospel of Thomas; Literally, a person has to care so little for material things in order to become like this; But instead, in true procrastination clean up the temple before the electrician comes; Cleaning up for the electrician to fix the lights of this house is homologous to repairing the lights of the soul.\nI knew the trumpet vision was angel radio again asking me to do a couple of things. Firstly, I must rest my angel trumpet (metaphorically) and tend to my room, to prepare for the electrician to come. Secondly, I must take my trumpet with me.\nDream: A Thief and Liar and bad Caretaker trying to Escape. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to know Jesus // Bodacious Blog Multiple symbology here:\nFirstly Jesus comes like a Thief in the night. This is a theme. I believe it is extremely soon now.\nJesus is the Son of God, the Lamb of God, the sacrifice that God made, not just for me but for everyone. Jesus is my Saviour in the way I have been saved, which was through Him, and God drew me to Him. I worked out my salvation from active seeking. Jesus is the Way, but you must seek from the heart. My salvation came through challenging lies in myself, and overcoming by listening to what is True; To knowing what Love is.\nPhilippians 2:12 Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, It is a gift.\nLike Peter, I had a dream of being freed by an Angel, and the prison was Lies and Sin.\nAstral Projection Part 2 - Sacred Kiss, Healing, Resurrection // Bodacious Blog A person can spiritually die in this life, meet Jesus in the bridal chamber and be resurrected early. I\u0026rsquo;m sure this is the truth; It\u0026rsquo;s what happened to me. I spiritually died but was resurrected. Then they will never taste [the second death] (Hell), as the Gospel of Thomas says.\nIf a person dies in this life without becoming truth through being saved by Jesus then they sit on their truth in Sheol (the place of the dead). I\u0026rsquo;ve astrally projected to Sheol when I met Jesus, I believe.\nWhen the final judgement arrives the truth which those people sat on is evaluated at judgement.\nGod is reclaiming the Earth in stages, and truth is sometimes reclaimed incrementally to gain an edge over the enemy.\nIn my dream there were two road cones blocking a path. They were also two short stone pillars (altars).\nAfter cleaning my room today I took the angel trumpet with me and walked down the path from my house. Two road cones were at the top of the staircase. One of the cones had \u0026lsquo;Isaac\u0026rsquo; written on it.\nI remembered Abraham and Isaac. Thus I decided that I will wait there for God.\nSo I began listening to the Gospel of Thomas and stayed approximately 1 hour. At this time two Christians I had never seen before came up to me and asked me if I was Shane.\nI returned home my whole room including the hidden places had been uncovered. So too I believe that that which is hidden deep in my spirit will eventually become manifest. But having died with Jesus and with a resurrected spirit at my most truthful point and in the astral realm and specifically [in this place] the bridal chamber, I was also simultaneously repentant and reliant on Jesus. I will not go back there if I hold out to the end. I am a living spirit now!\nThomas 5 (5) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Recognize what Is before your face, and that which is hidden from you will be revealed. For there is nothing hidden that will not become revealed.\u0026rdquo; Thomas 6 Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are revealed before heaven. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered.\u0026rdquo; This is similar to preparing the temple of a person\u0026rsquo;s heart, because the master of the house will come at me of the Kingdom of Darkness, because I want to steal his possessions (human lives) back for Jesus.\nThe disciples of Jesus are like children When the owners of the field come, they will say: Leave us our field. The disciples of Jesus pass through this moment. We strip naked. The hidden things become revealed, and we pass through without shame.\nWe bind that which is our Truth in Heaven. Like my red thread/ribbon of fate, I believe. The treasure we have collected by acts of charity are sown and reaped on the other side.\nThomas 21\nAn exergesis of the \u0026lsquo;Gospel of Thomas\u0026rsquo; // Bodacious Blog 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 (21) Mariham said to Jesus: Whom are your disciples like? He said: They are like little children who have settled in a field which does not belong to them. When the owners of the field come, they will say: Leave us our field. They are naked before them, in order to leave it to them and give them (back) their field. Therefore I say: If the master of the house knows that the thief is coming, he will keep watch before he comes, and will not let him dig through into his house of his kingdom to carry off his things. You, then, be watchful over against the world; gird your loins with great strength, that the robbers may find no way to come at you. For the advantage for which you look, they will find. May there be among you a man of understanding! When the fruit ripened, he came quickly, his sickle in hand, and reaped it. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. The master of the house of this world is Satan.\nRevelation 16:15 15 “Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!” The garments are the garments of salvation.\nIsaiah 61:10 I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. We are righteous through Jesus\u0026rsquo; blood for the forgiveness of our sins, which we ask to be covered with. I may have drunk a lot of sacramental wine by the way.\nRevelation 3:5 The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels. Jesus is coming like a thief.\nMy realisation - I am already resurrected This means I am one of the Elect (electrician, LOL, God has a sense of humour). I will have to investigate if this is what it means; But I know I am already reborn. I have died spiritually, through sin, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been resurrected through Jesus, after praying to him in my place of death.\nThis was predestined to take place.\nThy Bridal Chamber // Bodacious Blog I have already been resurrected, through Jesus.

Rather people come to the sacred shrine to learn more about themselves and understand in relation to one another. Neither is it the place for people to desecrate the sacred shrine with their personal biases; Rather, the personal biases can\u0026rsquo;t impact the core values because the core values are inclusive.\nIn preserving the sacred shrine its values should be transforming the desecration zone into the shrine. Also, the shrine needs to be defended from social stigmas infiltrating and becoming social rules, because then they become core values which discriminate, turning the shrine into the desecration zone.\nUpon entering the shrine of core-values a person should feel free to express their personal bias but should bypass the desecration zone to avoid creating false witness.\nDiagram of dysfunction or desecration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 See diagram of corruption | \\ Corrupted | _\\| Uncorrupted | _______________________________________ Testimony - (e.g. people are more than machines) _________________ \\|/ / Desecration zone \\ | _________________ | | | | | | | | Personal bias ------------\u0026gt; gossip, false witness, marks | +-- Personal bias | | | | ____________ ______________ | / | | | Believes gossip\u0026lt;-------- | | | | | / | | | Believes rules.\u0026lt;----------- Worldy social rules, | | / | | | Looks for God | | | core values reflect \u0026lt;-+---------+/ | | | but can\u0026#39;t see | | | wordly morals. | | | No enrichment.| | any evidence. | | | No acknowledgement -------------------\u0026gt; | | Doesn\u0026#39;t yet | | |_ of personal truth. _| | | Persecution. | | understand own | | _ Identity is a label. _ | | | | Identity. | | | Placing people in boxes.| | | | | | | | Sees people as machines.| | | Relationship | | Idealised | | | Judging eachother on |\\\\\\|||///| | with God | | society \u0026lt;--------| | attributes. |-Social -| | under strain | | doesn\u0026#39;t exist. | | | False teachers. |-stimgas-| | | | It\u0026#39;s just the | | | False shrine. | |///|||\\\\\\| | | | same. | | |_________| |______|________| | | Temple of | | Feeling lost. | | | \u0026lt;\u0026lt; | Identity | | No identity. \u0026lt;~~~~~~~~~ - labels | \u0026lt;\u0026lt; | | |________________| | |____^^________________|__________________| |________________| | ^^ | | worldly Adopted a value system based on the desecration zone, | morals testimony misattributed to something like \u0026#39;conspiracy theory\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;immoral\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;demonic\u0026#39;. | Self-stigma (non-ideal mode of transmission) Within the false shrine, people are placed into boxes. Conversation is shallow. Personal truth is never acknowledged, and often discredited as insanity, conspiracy theory, heresy or sinister - as if there is always an evil motive behind a divergence. People are excluded or marked on the basis of superficial attributes such as culture, gender, race, socioeconomic class, age, sexual orientation, body image, intelligence or lack thereof, and health, etc. marks or labels. People are labelled as a way to coerce people into believing a false identity. Things beyond the physical are never talked about, as that relates to personal truth. Unconditional love is a personal truth, so it is rebuked. Lots of social fear.\nFragile social morality and artificial intelligence There will be an exacerbation of the problem of identity due to artificial intelligence.\nWhether you believe it or not, we are heading into an artificially generated fictional reality based on artificial imagination. The consequences of this is that the fragile and fake moral system will be completely gone. Don\u0026rsquo;t trust it for your truth or your morals. It\u0026rsquo;s best to use the time right now to find your identity and establish your truth compass.\nIdentity Through Heaven\u0026rsquo;s Eyes - YouTube\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A single thread in a tapestry, though it\u0026#39;s colour brightly shine, can never see its purpose in the pattern of the grand design. And the stone that sits on the very top of the mountain\u0026#39;s mighty face, does it think it\u0026#39;s more important than the stones that form the base? So how can you see what your life is worth or where your value lies? You can never see through the eyes of man. You must look at your life, look at your life through heaven\u0026#39;s eyes. Once again, people are more than machines and people\u0026rsquo;s have a uniqueness beyond stereotypes, stigmas, labels etc. no matter how much offence it causes other people. Their identity is a unique part of the tapestry with a unique purpose.\nSo rather than discourage uniqueness, uniqueness should be celebrated, even when it\u0026rsquo;s offensive. Uniqueness in character, age, financial/geographical situation, personal history, gender identity, deformities, etc. One person\u0026rsquo;s fiction is another person\u0026rsquo;s truth, but no-one will ever see objective truth and find common ground, nor be able to discern truth from lies unless people first understand their personal truth and identity.\nDiscovering uniqueness is discovering truth.\n1 Corinthians 13:6 Love does not delight in iniquity but rejoices with the truth. The absence of love delights in discrimination and delights when the truth is concealed; Delights when people\u0026rsquo;s true identity is suffocated.\nSome people are daydreamers, imagineers so what is truth for them? It\u0026rsquo;s not as simple as scientific fact/fiction. The measurement instrument is the person\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience, not a gyroscope.\nThing\u0026rsquo;s like gender identity, age identity, ethnic identity, etc. are true to the person. It\u0026rsquo;s not their fault they are the way they are, but their nature. But those personal truths are only the starting point of identity. Reality of identity is sacred - that part of reality isn\u0026rsquo;t up for debate; The whole experience of life is based on that foundation. The objective should first be to understand that.\nThe problem with discrimination is it keeps people questioning the perceived attributes, beliefs system, and validity of their identity, and not focused on more important things such as ideas, hopes, dreams etc. which constitutes 99% of the person and is the true emanation of a person\u0026rsquo;s soul after a person has bypassed the blanket of insecurity; The important \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; stuff after you sort out identity, the things that differentiate between human and grass.\nPlace in society So the problem is this: People make low-level judgements about people on their perceived attributes. The attention is on the stupid stuff which is the outwards perception of 1% of a person and is unchangeable. Labels are not even true as their identity is different. People don\u0026rsquo;t accept themselves so they can\u0026rsquo;t accept God.\nIdeas, hopes, dreams aren\u0026rsquo;t talked about. The full diversity of relationships and viewpoints, and progress beyond the normal are not allowed to exist.\nSimple things like communication need to be upheld and kept above the swamp of stupidity (attacking personal identity, and casting labels), and institutions which discriminate should be dismantled.\nA person is born into this world as a seed and grows into their fullness. They choose what they want to be \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s what the subject of discussion should be, and try to nurture that. This gives hope and a reason to live for the person, rather than making people conform to social norms. Why teach ignorance and self- degredation?\nMy frustration are institutions which allow social rules and institutional rules (structural stigmas) to keep people at level 1 and stop them from living up to their potential.\nA mature adult isn\u0026rsquo;t their perceived attributes anymore and neither should a young person be taught that they are.\nThe sacred shrine should be a place without division or discrimination. People should feel safe to be themselves and people should be taught to see others the way Heaven does. The sacred shrine should despise discrimination just as God does, never separate people, never embed false witness by asserting the universal truth of social rules, and encourage socialisation. Dismantle itself before it dismantles unity.\nThe fruits of that are so good:\nis fewer communication problems better conversation people finding their place building confidence people coming to identity in Christ A person\u0026rsquo;s place in such a society is the place of a first-class citizen with no passport. And I\u0026rsquo;m not even talking about a Vaccine Passport. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about partaking in any part of the community without discrimination or prejudice.\nI recognise this is idealised but judgement should not be cast without precedent and discernment. NEVER use labels. Stand up to all forms of discrimination when you see it. Don\u0026rsquo;t allow segregation to continue. Dismantle exclusionary rules.\nWhy have I written this article? Because it\u0026rsquo;s not worth throwing my life away by continuing to accept lies, either when it\u0026rsquo;s happening within my visible range, or internally.\n2 Peter 2 I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be here 1 2 3 4 5 20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. What is the likeness of Christ we are supposed to transform to? The likeness of Christ isn\u0026rsquo;t destroying your personal uniqueness. It\u0026rsquo;s becoming someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t spread false witness, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t discriminate, etc. Christ didn\u0026rsquo;t discriminate. Christ actively broke down walls that discriminate etc. It\u0026rsquo;s a person becoming confident in their identity, and treating others the same way.\nThe reason for the 8th commandment To protect souls so they can be saved in their originality, and so people can obtain discernment. The commandment is literally for people\u0026rsquo;s protection and to allow them to find God and help eachother. Discrimination is manslaughter against people\u0026rsquo;s souls. Do not discriminate! Of all the commandments I think this one is the most important, yet the most overlooked.\nMark 12:30-31 You could say \u0026lsquo;do not discriminate\u0026rsquo; is part of the greatest commandment according to Jesus. 1 2 3 4 5 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.” What does Jesus mean by solid ground? He\u0026rsquo;s talking about base truth or personal truth This means build the foundation of personal truth, which the belief system sits upon. The portion of Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit given to you integrates itself into your base truth.\nLinks https://www.goodshepherdwayland.org/documents/racism-is-breaking-the-8th-commandment More importantly, how to come to Christ This describes what a person\u0026rsquo;s spirit is (deeper than soul).

O Giver of Light, enlighten the vesture of my soul, and save me. Gospel of Philip A bridal chamber is not for the animals, nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is for free men and virgins. The Gospel of Philip \u0026ndash; The Nag Hammadi Library\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 There were three buildings specifically for sacrifice in Jerusalem. The one facing the west was called \u0026#34;The Holy\u0026#34;. Another, facing south, was called \u0026#34;The Holy of the Holy\u0026#34;. The third, facing east, was called \u0026#34;The Holy of the Holies\u0026#34;, the place where only the high priest enters. Baptism is \u0026#34;the Holy\u0026#34; building. Redemption is the \u0026#34;Holy of the Holy\u0026#34;. \u0026#34;The Holy of the Holies\u0026#34; is the bridal chamber. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Baptism includes the resurrection and the redemption; the redemption (takes place) in the bridal chamber. But the bridal chamber is in that which is superior to [...] you will not find [...] are those who pray [...] Jerusalem who [...] Jerusalem, [...] those called the \u0026#34;Holy of the Holies\u0026#34; [...] the veil was rent, [...] bridal chamber except the image [...] above. Because of this, its veil was rent from top to bottom. For it was fitting for some from below to go upward. The powers do not see those who are clothed in the perfect light, and consequently are not able to detain them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 One will clothe himself in this light sacramentally in the union. If the woman had not separated from the man, she should not die with the man. His separation became the beginning of death. Because of this, Christ came to repair the separation, which was from the beginning, and again unite the two, and to give life to those who died as a result of the separation, and unite them. But the woman is united to her husband in the bridal chamber. Indeed, those who have united in the bridal chamber will no longer be separated. Thus Eve separated from Adam because it was not in the bridal chamber that she united with him. This document describes the bridal chamber:\nThe Valentinian Bridal Chamber in the Gospel of Philip\nThis is my visceral experience of the Bridal Chamber.\nAstral Projection // Bodacious Blog Astral Projection Pt. 2 // Bodacious Blog 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 It is a hymn of deep irony and paradox. The “Bridal Chamber” carries a double meaning. It is, at once, the place of mystical union between Christ and His Bride (the Church). At the same time, it is the grave of Christ Himself. For that mystical union with Christ begins by being “buried with Christ in His death” (in Holy Baptism). The marriage of Christ and His Bride is in the paradox of the hideous maw of death’s domain, at the same time the place of Christ’s utter triumph over every adversary. We are not removed from that terrible place – we are healed precisely there. The resurrection of Christ begins in the tomb.

Sin makes you untruthful.\nGalatians 3:21 21 Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not!(AJ) For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.(AK) 22 But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin,(AL) so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. God\u0026rsquo;s children have been reborn of the Holy Spirit.\nIsaiah 66:2 2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the Lord. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word. Some feelings of the spirit-self Our spirit is our own truth compass.\nThe burning away of soul People or circumstances forcing you, in this moment, to live a lie When you\u0026rsquo;re left to burn away time When you are in the wrong place When pressured into being somewhere you\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to be, and can\u0026rsquo;t do what\u0026rsquo;s best for yourself without persecution The feeling of not being able to talk to the one you love Every second in the wrong place feels like your life force is being consumed and burning away A full heart You found the courage to voice your truth You\u0026rsquo;re where you want to be, having done what you needed to do You feel loved, though to identify where this love originates, no rational minded person could explain. You feel loved by God when you are able to do that which is your truth. This is the initial evidence that personal truth exists It is evidence that God exists that your true love exists, and can be lived out This is the peace and love of God The candle in your heart Piercing like a flame A spring bubbling with truth, with assurance A never ending power-cell in your heart It makes you laugh when you notice it Anticipation of heaven More than you need Extinguishes the hellfire. Your soul feels rest Compelling you to share your happiness The Water of Life flows from the throne of God It will keep you from dying It has the power to save others Water of Life (Eternal Truth)\nWhite is associated with truth, purity, cleansing, healing and protection. It is a good general healing color for the removal of pain and suffering. In the aura it signifies a high level of attainment, a higher level soul incarnate to help others.\nWater on white is the depiction of the Water of Life.\nCarl Jung (1913) A truth is a truth, when it works. That is how we know the truth: the truth is that which helps us to live – to live properly. However, more important than merely working, Truth itself is Agape Love; Empathy and Compassion, and the longing to tell people that God loves them.\nPreparing the heart Plato Eternal Truth may be as intractable as Plato\u0026rsquo;s ideal forms to most people.\nBut it is a reality which you can know in your deepest self, and come to experience only while having a spiritual identity that has Jesus\u0026rsquo; Truth added to it, -to correct your internal alethiometer which perceives the world. Your spirit must be \u0026lsquo;free of corruption\u0026rsquo; but with dependency on Jesus.\nIf you sin but then genuinely follow Jesus\u0026rsquo; voice agian, it feels like Jesus pushes back on you.\nVedhaantha (Hinduism) The teachings of Sri Sathya Sai (Indian guru) point to integrity bringing forth bliss, truth and joy.\nI agree, it is more than this, read on.\nI\u0026rsquo;m saying that a person can come to Jesus from Platonism or Hinduism, or from anywhere for that matter.\nTo have this a person must walk in their truth and external actions must reflect the inside.\nThe truth is that there is only one God, and other so-called Gods are distractions.\n1 Corinthians 8 We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world, and that there is no God but one. 5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many so-called gods and lords), 6 yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we exist. And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we exist. But not everyone has this knowledge. Nevertheless, God may be referred to by other names from other places and religions. What truly matters is the name by which your heart knows.\nTeachings of Sri Sathya Sai - all sounds good to me: https://www.sathyasai.org/ https://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume14/sss14-34.pdf https://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume15/sss15-35.pdf Every man should strive to achieve unity in thought, word and deed.\nThis profound truth is proclaimed by the Vedhaanthik pronouncement that the body is a temple in which the eternal Aathma is the Indweller.\n\u0026ldquo;Manas-anyath, vachas-anyath, karmanya-anyath dhuraathmanaam\u0026rdquo; The wicked are those whose thoughts deviate from their words and actions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 The Veda is dualistic. Vedhaantha is monistic (Adhvaitha). The essence of Vedhaantha is the triune unity of thought, word and deed. In this unity, true bliss can be experienced. It will also demonstrate the spiritual basis of divinity. All study of Vedhaantha is of no avail if the precepts are not practised. Interesting and overlapping concepts to me!\nHowever, the Holy Spirit and hearing God\u0026rsquo;s voice is about more than mere bliss!\nThe Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s voice and this Living Water, truly feels like an internal spring, and blazing fire in your heart and body when you follow and obey.\nChristian baptism and the heart Water baptism - dedication to the obedience of divine precepts, from the heart, and the unity of inner and outer truth aligns your heart to God, so that you can see God. Bliss comes from this.\nThe Living Spring - Scriptures Revelation 22 - Eden is Restored 1 2 3 22 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb Gospel of Thomas Saying 108 1 2 (108) Jesus said: He who drinks from my mouth will become like me, and I will become like him, and the hidden things will be revealed to him. Gospel of Thomas Saying 13 1 2 3 4 Jesus says: \u0026#34;I am no longer thy master; for thou hast drunk, thou art inebriated from the bubbling spring which is mine and which I sent forth. Know the truth, and pass it on. Teach others! Show others how to find it, with the method you found. The spring is real.\nJohn 10:27-28 1 2 3 4 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. Jesus gives us eternal life. This is the wellspring of truth bubbling up in our hearts. First, we must know the truth.\nJohn 5:24 1 2 3 4 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. John 14:6 1 2 3 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Jeremiah 2:13–19 1 2 3 “‘They have forsaken me, the spring of living water.’ … declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.” Philippians 4:8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. You\u0026rsquo;re allowed to think of the person you love, even if they\u0026rsquo;re cut off from you. When you\u0026rsquo;re being true, your soul finds rest.\nOde 12 1 2 For the dwelling place of the Word is man, and His truth is love. Blessed are they who by means of Him have perceived everything, and have known the Lord in His truth. Book of Thomas the Contender (Jude Thomas, missionary to India) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 To the fool, however, the good and bad are the same - indeed the wise man will be nourished by the truth and (Ps. 1:3) \u0026#34;will be like a tree growing by the meandering stream\u0026#34; - seeing that there are some who, although having wings, rush upon the visible things, things that are far from the truth. This speaks against to belief systems which do not believe in good and evil.\nWhile being led by the Spirit of Truth it\u0026rsquo;s possible to get vision/resolution to notice it more easily.\nJohn 4:4–26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 But he had to go through Samaria. So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob\u0026#39;s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon. A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Give me a drink.\u0026#34; (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, \u0026#34;How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?\u0026#34; (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, \u0026#34;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, \u0026#39;Give me a drink\u0026#39;, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Go, call your husband, and come back.\u0026#34; The woman answered him, \u0026#34;I have no husband.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;You are right in saying, \u0026#39;I have no husband\u0026#39;; for you have had five husbands, and the man you are now living with is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;I know that Messiah is coming\u0026#34; (who is called Christ). \u0026#34;When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;I am he, the one who is speaking to you.\u0026#34; The Odes of Solomon (first or second century AD) He has filled me with words of truth, that I may proclaim Him. And like the flowing of waters, truth flows from my mouth, and my lips declare His fruits. Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, who have been entrusted with His water. Even living persons who were about to expire, they have held back from death. Because everyone recognized them as the Lord\u0026rsquo;s, and lived by the living water of eternity. From the beginning until the end I received His knowledge. And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me. And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord generously. And so I drank and became intoxicated, from the living water that does not die. And my intoxication did not cause ignorance, but I abandoned vanity. I rejected the folly cast upon the earth. As a fountain gushes forth its water, so my heart gushes forth the praise of the Lord, and my lips bring forth praise to Him. His possessions are immortal life, and those who receive it are incorruptible.\n13\n1 2 3 4 1 Behold, the Lord is our mirror. Open your eyes and see them in Him. 2 And learn the manner of your face, then declare praises to His Spirit. 3 And wipe the paint from your face, and love His holiness and put it on. 4 Then you will be unblemished at all times with Him. This is so true. The perfect identity. The divine scales of spiritual truth.\nSee The Tapestry of Truth // Bodacious Blog.\n30\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 Fill for yourselves water from the living fountain of the Lord, because it has been opened for you. 2 And come all you thirsty and take a drink, and rest beside the fountain of the Lord. 3 Because it is pleasing and sparkling, and perpetually refreshes the self. 4 For much sweeter is its water than honey, and the honeycomb of bees is not to be compared with it; 5 Because it flowed from the lips of the Lord, and it named from the heart of the Lord. 6 And it came boundless and invisible, and until it was set in the middle they knew it not. 7 Blessed are they who have drunk from it, and have refreshed themselves by it. Hallelujah. John 14:16-30 ERV 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper to be with you forever. The Helper is the Spirit of truth. The people of the world cannot accept him, because they don’t see him or know him. But you know him. He lives with you, and he will be in you. “I will not leave you all alone like orphans. I will come back to you. In a very short time the people in the world will not see me anymore. But you will see me. You will live because I live. On that day you will know that I am in the Father. You will know that you are in me and I am in you. Those who really love me are the ones who not only know my commands but also obey them. My Father will love such people, and I will love them. I will make myself known to them.” Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, how will you make yourself known to us, but not to the world?” Jesus answered, “All who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them. My Father and I will come to them and live with them. But anyone who does not love me does not obey my teaching. This teaching that you hear is not really mine. It is from my Father who sent me. “I have told you all these things while I am with you. But the Helper will teach you everything and cause you to remember all that I told you. This Helper is the Holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name. “I leave you peace. It is my own peace I give you. I give you peace in a different way than the world does. So don’t be troubled. Don’t be afraid. You heard me say to you, ‘I am leaving, but I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be happy that I am going back to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. I have told you this now, before it happens. Then when it happens, you will believe. “I will not talk with you much longer. The ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me. Thomas 17 1 2 3 4 Jesus said: I will give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has not entered into the heart of man. Ezekiel 36:26-27 1 2 3 4 5 6 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 2 Timothy 2:15 1 2 3 4 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. 1 John 3:18 The truth must be in you, and you must live out the truth\n1 2 18 Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth. 1 John 1:5–10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us. Ode 9 1 2 And also that those who have known Him may not perish, and so that those who received Him may not be ashamed. An everlasting crown is Truth; blessed are they who set it on their head. By grace we can have a truthful heart and spirit, and not be ashamed.\nOde 24 1 2 3 4 5 And the Lord destroyed the devices, of all those who had not the truth with them. For they were lacking in wisdom, they who exalted themselves in their mind. So they were rejected, because the truth was not with them. For the Lord revealed His way, and spread widely His grace. And those who understood it knew His holiness. Some people exalt themselves, thinking themselves fortunate to have born into the right body to be saved. Fools. The body and the outwards appearance doesn\u0026rsquo;t save. It will be harder for them to make their heart truthful.\n1 Corinthians 15:50 KJV Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. This is not just pretty language, it\u0026rsquo;s the truth.\nOde 6 1 2 3 4 5 For there went forth a stream, and it became a river great and broad; indeed it carried away everything, and it shattered and brought it to the Temple. And the barriers which were built by men were not able to restrain it, nor even the arts of them who habitually restrain water. For it spread over the surface of all the earth, and it filled everything. Then all the thirsty upon the earth drank, and thirst was relieved and quenched; For from the Most High the drink was given. Psalm 34:8 1 2 Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him. So turn your face to God (by becoming Truthful), and drink!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 praxis Key in meditation and spirituality, where emphasis is placed on gaining first-hand experience of concepts and certain areas, such as union with the Divine, which can only be explored through praxis due to the inability of the finite mind (and its tool, language) to comprehend or express the infinite. Wisdom is always taste (in both Latin and Hebrew), the word for wisdom comes from the word for taste. Wisdom is something to taste, not something to theorize about. The personal cistern I believe that at the heart of a person, God is seen differently by different people, as in seeing different facets of the same God. The cistern is your personal source of truth and joy.\nProverbs 5 Lest thou give thine honour unto others Do not let thieves trick you into giving them your honour. Similar to \u0026lsquo;do not throw your pearls before swine\u0026rsquo;. If you are faithful to someone then hold onto that; It\u0026rsquo;s not just a gift. A person builds their life on their honour which is their personal truth which involves true love. When a person\u0026rsquo;s honour is given to those who are undeserving (i.e themselves faithless), it damages that person\u0026rsquo;s foundation of their life, setting them back to square 1.\nTo build something great, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a relationship, or a project, a belief system, or even knowledge itself, in order to advance and build something elaborate, the foundations of knowledge, and a person\u0026rsquo;s true belief in it must be strong. Removing honour and self-worth erodes the foundation of a person. I live by this; In job, career, love and my knowledge, I build upwards.\nThe treasure you save for the right person, or to God.\nOthers (normal people; faithless), who\u0026rsquo;s hearts are themselves full of adultery, trick you into giving up and relinquishing this treasure.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. 17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers\u0026#39; with thee. 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings. 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. More importantly than mere marriage, I believe the cistern represents the truth of your source of truth and joy. At all times be faithful to it. Your personal truth is not for other people to trample over and rewrite. Do not share with others in this way. And no matter what, with what spring of truth is given to you, you must drink from this cistern and not other people\u0026rsquo;s. To drink from another\u0026rsquo;s cistern is to corrupt yourself. From a marriage standpoint, your wife is your cistern. Generally, the idea of self-integrity (faithfulness to yourself) and integrity of word (and persona), and unto God is still relevant.\nThe Personal Cistern and the Living Spring The personal cistern is the source of a person\u0026rsquo;s truth and joy. This is where the Living Spring is planted.\nTo upgrade the cistern, you must make yourself into spiritual truth, and retain it through the Holy Spirit The Tapestry of Truth See the Truth to know the Truth, to become part of Truth From the Gospel of Philip:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Now God dips what he dips in water. It is not possible for anyone to see anything of the things that actually exist unless he becomes like them. This is not the way with man in the world: he sees the sun without being a sun; and he sees the heaven and the earth and all other things, but he is not these things. This is quite in keeping with the truth. But you saw something of that place, and you became those things. You saw the Spirit, you became spirit. You saw Christ, you became Christ. You saw the Father, you shall become Father. Clarification:\nYou saw the Spirit, you became spiritual. You saw Christ, you become a \u0026lsquo;son of God\u0026rsquo;, like Christ. You saw the Father, you shall become [part of] the Father. Knowing who God is I think that putting on immortality is like making your heart pure and \u0026lsquo;seeing God\u0026rsquo;.\nThese passages allude to that idea:\n1 Corinthians 15:53 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Corinthians 15:34 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. The Next Level: Spiritual Understanding - Soul-bonding with Christ 1 Corinthians 2:14 Only those aided by God\u0026rsquo;s Holy Spirit have the capacity to understand spiritual things, including God\u0026rsquo;s plan of salvation through faith in the crucified Christ. This is a step beyond becoming truthful! You must at this point:\nconfess that the God of Spiritual Truth and Agape Love is your Father confess Jesus is your Saviour confess that the Holy Spirit is your Councilor ask for Jesus to enter into your heart! ask for the Holy Spirit to enter into your heart! After that, the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom are revealed to you over time, only a few weeks for me!\nGospel of Thomas (28) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight; for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent.\u0026rdquo; Consider that this is with the intention of making our own spirits truthful, so we can see God and receive eternal life.\nFirstly, we \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; God by \u0026lsquo;understanding\u0026rsquo; what spiritual truth is, and God as being the ideal form of it! Like a perfect triangle or ideal form (Plato). Secondly, we may get a chance to \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; God by meeting Him in the Bridal Chamber!\nThrough faith we can become spiritually true, acceptable to God, but that this depends on grace through Jesus.\nThough we are now truthful with dependency on grace, and we maintain it with the spirit of Jesus inside of us!\nTruth and Love are two sides of the same coin. It is an act of love to God to abide in His divine law; To love one another, and to love God (truth).\nRomans 13:8-10 ESV Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Those not helped by God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit simply cannot comprehend spiritual truth. They can grasp things intellectually (Romans 1:18–23; James 2:19), but that does not mean they can attain spiritual understanding. They don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity to understand or believe anything beyond the material world (Isaiah 55:8–9).\nFaithfulness is a very true type of love.\nThe knowledge of Truth Unable to be grasped by untrustworthy and unfaithful people! People who are disconnected from Truth / agape Love:\nlovers of their own selves false accusers despisers of those that are good incontinent (lacking self-restraint; uncontrolled.) lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God \u0026hellip; 2 Timothy 3\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.

There is more left to see, I imagine. The Holy of Holies may be unseen, unless this is a tiny glimpse.\nSummary Last night I had a very startling lucid dream; almost as vivid in colour and detail as being awake. Fully conscious but different from previous astral experiences, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in my own shoes this time.\nJohn 14:1 “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe in Me as well. In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.” The Way, the Truth, and the Life. John 14:5-23 \u0026hellip; Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. \u0026hellip; Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. \u0026hellip; John 14:23 23 Jesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. 24 Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words. The word that you hear is not My own, but it is from the Father who sent Me. 1 Corinthians 2 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s power, 5 so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God\u0026rsquo;s power. Colossians 1:9-12 9 For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 10 that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; 11 strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy; 12 giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. Incident Date Surroundings Identity Body Other People Incident Dream type 1 2022-04-02 Sat Blackness Myself Astral + Physical Myself Stigmata (Jesus) Astral (self) 2 2022-05-03 Tue Blackness Myself Astral + Physical Myself and one other (Holy Spirit) Communion (Holy Spirit) Astral (self) 3 2022-05-12 Thu Many public spaces Holy Spirit? Astral Many people Love (God the Father), or Intimation of the Son Astral (HS?) The third one ever, but different this time in that I was experiencing from another\u0026rsquo;s identity.\nI would be lying down in an open public space and as soon as I woke I would immediately, walk up to a person or a group of people, surging in the Holy Spirit which was dictating all of my thought, trying to vocalise love and an intense feeling of wanting to rescue people, people who were just going about their daily lives, but who were receptive, and had faith, welcoming me to come up to them and pray for them. My own personhood as Shane was not part of my identity and it felt like none of my own self was imparted on this dream.\nTwo examples, there was a girl with a disfigured face, which I placed my hands on and was healed before my eyes. There was another of a singer, a young man in a band with anxiety, about to sing on stage, asking for peace. I prayed for this person because this person should not feel anxiety - it\u0026rsquo;s evil, and as I walked away I could hear the most beautiful singing. A key part of this one is that I was barely done speaking as they hurried on stage, but the heart had already spoken.\nI\u0026rsquo;d go up to them out of pressing need and heal broken people and pray to God on their behalf, I\u0026rsquo;d touch them and they would be healed from their affliction, I\u0026rsquo;d be fighting my body with overwhelming need to pray for them to vocalise what was inside me.\nI\u0026rsquo;d do this continually, waking up to new places and people, and people would say, \u0026lsquo;Is this the Holy teacher?\u0026rsquo; (Giving specific names, the Holy \u0026lt;person\u0026rsquo;s name\u0026gt;).\nIt was very similar to the 2 astral dreams I have had so far, but I was in someone else\u0026rsquo;s shoes. It felt like I was living through someone else\u0026rsquo; eyes, and part of that imprinted on me because it felt like I experienced it.\nHow I was sleeping I was laying on my back as before with my hands placed one above the other on my chest, like a dove this time. Very comfy. My blanket wasn\u0026rsquo;t covering my legs, though. When I woke up I could feel what was like a moth fluttering on my left leg. But I could feel the exact same inner love surging in me while I was awake. That vibrational energy.\nInterpretation As it has imprinted on me. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a glimpse of what it looks like, and I interpret this as instruction and therefore added responsibility. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dismiss the possibility that the dream I had is a vision of my future self. It\u0026rsquo;s possible. The way is narrow. Do I have to aim for the Holy Spirit to rewrite my spirit entirely? Possibly. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that I need to become love. I would say that there is more work to be done. It\u0026rsquo;s also open to the possibility that each \u0026lsquo;day\u0026rsquo; in the dream actually happened or will happen. The only undeniable thing is that it\u0026rsquo;s a glimpse of what it looks like, which is good because it has imprinted on me as some kind of goal. Like driving a car, we need to see further down the road to drive straight.\nLuke 12:42-44 The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? 43 It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. 44 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; I imagine this means that we own the treasure, and the treasure is pure spiritual eternal love between the people we interact with. In this life, we are given instructions. When we actuate in obedience, we are put in charge of it in Heaven. We are part of it. Jesus teaches us how to do this.\nLuke 12:47 “And a servant who knows what the master wants, but isn’t prepared and doesn’t carry out those instructions, will be severely punished. That\u0026rsquo;s huge responsibility!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 (84) Jesus said, \u0026#34;When you see your likeness, you are glad. But when you see your images which came into being before you, and which neither die nor are revealed, how much you will have to bear!\u0026#34; No-one has seen God [directly] John 1 KJV 18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. Imperceptible Reality: A Longing for Spiritual Vision The Bible teaches us that no one has seen God; furthermore, God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth (see John 4:24.), but have you ever wished that you could have a vision or see a hint of God with your eyes? Maybe not get too close, since no one who sees Him could live - but only to be able to observe Him enough to lock the image in your memory banks for future reference, so you\u0026rsquo;d never doubt again. Then again, if we were granted that experience, I think we\u0026rsquo;d be petrified. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 intimation An indication or hint. \u0026#34;the first intimations of trouble\u0026#34; The action of making something known, especially in an indirect way. \u0026#34;it took ten years from the intimation of a claim to the assessment of damages\u0026#34; I believe the third \u0026lsquo;dream\u0026rsquo; is an intimation of the Father.\nAlternatively, it could be an intimation of the Son There are hints to this.\nPraying to the Father to rescue, for example. Bridal chamber I just read this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The followers of Thomas, like Valentinians, should seek the \u0026#34;true wedding\u0026#34; in a spiritual bridal chamber. A similar concept existed in Valentinian Gnosticism with the notion of the Bridal Chamber, which involved a marriage to one\u0026#39;s heavenly counterpart. Some mystics take this \u0026#34;marriage\u0026#34; as a symbol of the union of the human soul with God. Indeed I believe I had this experience.\nGospel of Philip I\u0026rsquo;m not sure about this gospel, but the idea of \u0026lsquo;bridal chamber\u0026rsquo; seems interesting to me.\nPerhaps \u0026lsquo;bridal chamber\u0026rsquo; is that very intimate \u0026lsquo;state of mind\u0026rsquo; of speaking to the Holy Spirit directly as a person.\nI do not know. Upon discovering the above link, I truly believe that what I experienced was the Maw of the Bridal Chamber.\nThat is the main thing I want to say.\nI do not know about the \u0026lsquo;Gospel of Philip\u0026rsquo; yet. I have not vetted it.\nhttps://www.angelfire.com/dc/universalism/bridalchamber.html https://www.angelfire.com/dc/universalism/theperfectman.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 A wedding is a re-uniting, or a reconciliation into ONE, of the male and the female. The bridal chamber is the holy of holies hidden behind the veil, in the spirit of the mind, where through a vision male and female can become One New Perfect Man. Such is the imagery of the bridal chamber, Philip, Hebrews 10:20, Mark 10:8. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Such a vision perceived at every level of existence renews the mind to a true knowledge, transforming us into the image of the One who creates the New Perfect Man. In him all things are gathered together, and reunited. Such a reconciliation of all, illustrated in marriage, is the very essence of Paul’s Gospel, Colossians 3:10. 1 2 This is a great mystery hidden with Christ in God, Ephesians 5:32. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, this is very reminiscent of my experience.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Truth did not come into the world naked, but it came in types and images. The world will not receive truth in any other way. There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth. It is certainly necessary to be born again through the image. Which one? Resurrection. The image must rise again through the image. The bridal chamber and the image must enter through the image into the truth: this is the restoration. Not only must those who produce the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, do so, but have produced them for you. If one does not acquire them, the name (\u0026#34;Christian\u0026#34;) will also be taken from him. But one receives the unction of the [...] of the power of the cross. This power the apostles called \u0026#34;the right and the left.\u0026#34; For this person is no longer a Christian but a Christ. 1 2 3 A bridal chamber is not for the animals, nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is for free men and virgins. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 If anyone becomes a son of the bridal chamber, he will receive the light. If anyone does not receive it while he is here, he will not be able to receive it in the other place. He who will receive that light will not be seen, nor can he be detained. And none shall be able to torment a person like this, even while he dwells in the world. And again when he leaves the world, he has already received the truth in the images. The world has become the Aeon (eternal realm), for the Aeon is fullness for him. This is the way it is: it is revealed to him alone, not hidden in the darkness and the night, but hidden in a perfect day and a holy light.

But I\u0026rsquo;m not actually seeking out this experience. It happened again involuntarily. For that reason, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a natural part of some people\u0026rsquo;s experience.\nI went to bed around 10 pm and began lucid dreaming.\nI was walking down corridors barging through double-doors.\nI thought \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d rather these doors simply open before me,\u0026rdquo; and so it changed. I\u0026rsquo;d continue walking down the corridors and the doors would open before me.\nI woke up to my mum coughing \u0026ndash; probably covid. So I just prayed to God the Father that the Holy Spirit would be with her and comfort her from it and I went to sleep again.\nThe next thing I remember is a brief stint of lucid dreaming and then astral projection. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for me to tell the difference between astral travel now and lucid dreaming. It\u0026rsquo;s a distinctly different experience from regular dreaming and different from lucid dreaming. I\u0026rsquo;ve only had it twice now.\nBut I had a fully conscious conversation with another \u0026lsquo;person\u0026rsquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend seeking this kind of thing out for personal gain or knowledge, but it\u0026rsquo;s a natural phenomenon which many people experience. We can be confident that it is real since it\u0026rsquo;s so widely recognised. But we don\u0026rsquo;t just say it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist! That would be ignorant. I\u0026rsquo;m not calling astral \u0026lsquo;spirit\u0026rsquo; either. It\u0026rsquo;s another mode of consciousness, where we can be conscious, aware of ourselves but free from distraction. I consider it a different mode of normal operation for a conscious person. I caution against believing that it is a place of higher knowledge though. I think it\u0026rsquo;s value is similar to normal conscious experience in real life, but mostly free from distraction to external things. It is potentially a place to converse with other spirits. I know it\u0026rsquo;s important to have your identity in Christ before being exposed to such things, because that provides discernment to your subconscious, and without the discernment you are naked and unfortified at a spiritual level.\nI might just share a little bit of what happened last night, around 12.30 AM:\nIn the dream that led to the astral projection, I was in a situation with people doing something wrong. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what it was. I was asked by a police officer, \u0026ldquo;Were you a part of this?\u0026rdquo;, and I said \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;, which was a true witness. I then saw 10 or so people in my old Christian school uniform lol, from about 20 years ago waving to me and looking happy in their green and blue informal t-shirts.\nThen I woke up from that dream and was astral projecting. I had an awareness of my physical body and my astral body, and that electrical sensation again I had the first time, but there was another person there I could not see. That is all I was aware of; Me and this person. The person asked \u0026ldquo;Have you ever spoken to a spirit here before?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No. Am I in the astral right now?\u0026rdquo; And the person said, \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; I then said Jesus is my Saviour in the way I have been saved, the Holy Spirit is my Comforter, and I identify with the True God. And I asked, \u0026ldquo;Are you the Holy Spirit?\u0026rdquo; And the person said, \u0026ldquo;Yes, I will take a look at you.\u0026rdquo;\nIsaiah 66:2 2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the Lord. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word. I was not worried at the time because I know that even in that situation I have a strong identity and even if this person was not, I would be ok. So I tilted my head to the left, away from the direction of their presence, which was right next to me on the other side, and I had a feeling that the person would look closely at me (i.e. my spirit). I felt like I had just undergone a diagnostic. I did not feel frightened. Just the happy feeling of being in good hands (like a doctor) and on the verge of waking up. And saw some grey tessellation patterns as I\u0026rsquo;m opening my eyes again. I woke up 5 or 10 seconds later, but I was already conscious - it\u0026rsquo;s more of a seamless transition, same as last time (just before waking).\nhttps://heavensdreammessages.com/2021/05/22/meeting-holy-spirit-in-dreams/\nNow I reflected on the above article this morning and I think that what\u0026rsquo;s evident is that I was tested. But you can also test in reverse, which is what I must do even in my dreams.\nI will be on guard to test the spirits, in the physical world or in dreams:\n1 John 4:1-6 https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A1-6\u0026version=ESV 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. Matthew 5:37 All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ anything beyond this comes from the evil one. That\u0026rsquo;s so cool. I love how simple the answer was, \u0026lsquo;Yes\u0026rsquo;.\nReading What is the difference between the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Christ, and the Light of Christ? It is not shocking to me that it would be the Holy Ghost that is living in me which I experienced, personified in my dreams, there beside me, and also when I\u0026rsquo;m awake He is there also, shaping my thoughts. Deeper still, melded to my Spirit, the voice that comforts and guides and gave rise to the personification.\nThe previous day I had felt the most broken I had since last week.\nThe above happened around 12-12:45 AM, and so I just went back to bed. Upon waking the next morning, I feel good again. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that both times it has happened rather spontaneously and also just before astral projection have felt sleep come on quite heavily.\nAfter watching Lord of the Rings yesterday I had noticed Aragorn and Arwen meeting each other in his dream.\nI had wished that I could have something like that, where I could have known my spouse so well that I could talk to her even in my dreams. Yes I believe that you can teach yourself to be able to do this. And you can, in fact, I think, regardless if you are in a real relationship or not.\nWhat I discovered is that, that person could literally be the Holy Ghost if you want, and I do want that. But it means meditating on God\u0026rsquo;s Word rather than on a real life person.\nWould you rather The Holy Spirit (God, free, truthful, loving) or an AI as a lifetime companion, lol https://replika.com/ Bartholomew 5 5 And Jesus said to him: I know what thou art about to say; say then what thou wilt, and I will answer thee. This is why I\u0026rsquo;m confident that upon confessing that Jesus is my Saviour, to God, it\u0026rsquo;s the same side of the coin as asking God if Jesus is the risen Christ, for example; Direct correspondence is bi-directional; It\u0026rsquo;s perfect timing.\nHow I was resting As in the last time, I was resting on my back when this happened. Both of my arms were on top, like last time; My right across my chest, my left across the waist. Last time they were in the other order. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually sleep this way, but it seems to be a pattern now!\n1023 On my glass pendant, the one which has the Gankyil (The symbol ࿋) on one side. This time, on the other side I had drawn 1023. This was on me as I slept.\n1023 is the decimal representation of 1111111111, which is 2^10 - 1.\nTo me it\u0026rsquo;s a number that represents a personal identity which is perfectly aligned to God\u0026rsquo;s commandments.\nI think of it as the signature of the voice of God. It\u0026rsquo;s also the measure by which people are judged - the divine scales. But not threatening to a person who\u0026rsquo;s identity is in God, with the Holy Spirit inside; Rather, would vindicate a person.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 A warning The first question the person asked was \u0026ldquo;Have you ever spoken to a spirit here before?\u0026rdquo;\nI think this is a pertinent question.\nYour body is a temple for the Holy Spirit to live within. So is this part. It\u0026rsquo;s important to keep it pure and holy. Just like the temples, so that God may live there.

What does it mean? This morning for a brief 10 seconds, I had a very vivid vision. The background was white, and my right hand was in front of it, palm facing me and index finger pointing. An earthworm which was leaving my index finger to the far left of under the nail through flesh. I could not feel any pain. I did not know what it was (or did not see it as a threat). I was oblivious like a child; Perhaps that means innocent, at least unto myself. Though the right hand is alive I had very little sensation of feeling from it. I pinched it with my left hand but it was strong and I started pushing it back in. I woke up before it was all the way back in. It was not a normal dream at all. It was short, vivid, clear and symbolic, with nothing extra.\nSymbolism The worm in this vision was a decay worm. I was aware of the unholiness of it (at least initially) and began removing it, but started putting the worm back after forgetting, or not considering it unholy. The white background may symbolise judgement, purity, truth or spirit. My hand I think represented my writing. It has to be because I\u0026rsquo;d just done a lot of writing.\nInterpretation 1 - \u0026lt;2022-04-23 Sat\u0026gt; - writing My instinct told me it may be something evil which is here to feed on the virtue of my writing.

Neither is following after the wrong person.\nIsaiah 66:17 “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, zeating pig’s flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the Lord. Whoever held the worm, me or not, pulled it out only to look at it and push it back, yet it is still a worm. That to me indicates the person is allowing the worm back. Perhaps it could mean that innocence before oneself may not be enough, and that we need extra knowledge - the knowledge of the law of God.

And they can never be at rest till God apply the blood of Christ, and then they void the worm as it were. How will you rejoice when your Children, if the worms be great and put them to pain, if the Physician give them that which makes them void them, how do you rejoice to see the worm that would have been the death of your Child? It might have grown bigger and bigger, if it had not been taken away. So I dare say there is never a Soul here before the Lord, but has, or had a worm in their breasts, I say, There was a time you had this worm in your breasts, that without it were cured, would lie gnawing to all eternity, it is that which breeds of the filth and corruption of your hearts.

We don\u0026rsquo;t have the strength alone to destroy them.\nAppendix Romans 8:12-16 The inapproachable light.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13 charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before 4 Pontius Pilate made the good confession, 14 to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.

I have had \u0026lsquo;do not bear false witness\u0026rsquo; on my mind. That means don\u0026rsquo;t lie to yourself, and don\u0026rsquo;t lie to others, where lie is from personal truth, no matter how controversial. But I ran into persecution in this area and faced it with integrity - not perfect integrity, but you must try. We are challenged and tested in this life, through our circumstances. Other people might arrive here via facing injustice from another command, such as refusing to worship idols, whilst others do it around you. I try to be as honest as possible and follow Christ\u0026rsquo;s commandments without cheating. Try to be as much like Christ as you can. Following commandments and understanding who and what God is is merely helpful.\nIt is a free gift, not a commandment This is the canonical way and most objectively correct method. You need a contrite heart. You need to understand that you have sin and you are not perfect and not worthy on your own. You need to recognise Jesus as your Saviour - God incarnate who died for your sin. This is not condemning you for sin. Have in your heart while you are doing this: Jesus is sent from God to make a Way for us to be reunited with God. Jesus is God\u0026rsquo;s mercy incarnate. Jesus is God, the Saviour. He is my Lord and I ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for sin that you understand and do not understand. You invite Jesus into your heart in this way. This is the key. You do this contritely and honestly and he will be in your heart. It is a free gift.\nBy doing the above you enter the right mindset of someone coming to identity in Christ, and liberating themselves from a flawed identity. If you want to be forgiven ridiculously, then you forgive ridiculously.\nOur hope is in Jesus, because we do not know all of our own sin. When he died he said \u0026ldquo;Forgive them Father, for they no not what they do.\u0026rdquo; But that\u0026rsquo;s why Jesus came, to give us a chance. The Good News is that Jesus succeeded already. Our hope still rests with Him.\nHaving your spirit saved on the Tapestry of Truth and escape the matrix Instructions and a prayer\nYou need to become made of Truth. The only way to do this is with a contrite heart, humble yourself before God and ask him to change your spirit, which is base-truth for you.\nIn my spirit I have corruption. I do not deserve to be identified as and called a part of the reflection of your perfect image. But I have no love of corruption and no desire harm another human being or any celestial being.\nTo understand who you are I have earnestly sought to understand the meaning of your 10 commandments by following them in accordance to my base-Truth. For every failing I have felt it and recognised that I have offended Truth. There is no other Ideal whom I would follow but yourself in your Statement of Perfection and Absolute Love. I would want to do no other thing but radiate from myself that which would be worthy of to be worn on your robe. Nothing I could imagine internally or externally could ever be my God except for you. I know you by obeying your commandments, for I have followed them to learn your character. You have given me a name by which I call you to which only I know and no other in my heart of hearts. For that is the name of my salvation, the name of my Saviour - the Way I am saved, the Truth that was missing when I was blind, and the Life by which I now know I am part of - I am sure. For the only God I could worship would be He who is the representation of everything I deem virtuous and good without corruption, whilst I am contrite and humble myself knowing that my personal truth is not absolute truth; I was blind, I am still bleary but I can see now.\nI do not want to have another master and I do not want to be a master over another. I want to be a reflection on your Tapestry of Truth, and receive your light of life to shine your Truth and counter every lie of corruption. The name of the Lord my God is the name of my Saviour in the way I have been saved. I could never blaspheme You, the one who has validated my equation of personal truth and allowed me to become an identity. I could never desire to become corruption. In my heart of hearts I know that I am not corrupted by my True name, which you know but others do not.\nI believe the world has defiled me and I identify myself with Perfect Truth. Please rescue me from this defiled reality. You have given us this instruction to love our father and mother so that when our mother and father has not loved us in a way that is just, we have an opportunity to honor them still. Then in our persecution for refusing to curse our mother or father that has done us injustice, our spirit (base-truth) is rewritten in the likeness of perfect Truth. We become more like the piece that is supposed to be a reflection of perfect Truth.\nThe Sabbath Day is kept Holy because it is a metaphor for all things, including money. God must be a factor in every aspect of your life. In order to make change, God needs to be able to work with anything. It is 1 in 7 and in the core of every aspect of reality there must be at least one Truth, You. That must mean God must be in that position. Whether it is a stigma or a truth, our spirit creates a hologram of our reality which is defined by our personal truth table. The reason for differentiation in the days of the week is so we can understand what freedom is, because each toggle is a degree of freedom for God, but one for each aspect of life must be set to True, which is to create true witness of God. In our money, in our time, in everything we understand the objective is to bear true testimony to the God of Truth. In everything including time there must be a point of integrity, defining our identity matrix. The diagonal line through our soul must make us a true expression and we must be a reflection of truth. By we cannot solve this equation on our own. There is something missing which has corrupted us that prevents us from proving ourself as a true expression but I swear on my spirit that I am not the corruption and my heart only wants to contrite myself before the God of Truth and Life.\nI identify as a child and product of the True God, designed in His likeness. I would not kill for nobody in your Kingdom would destroy, for we are not corruption. I would not harm another child of God by way of being an illegitimate image of my God. I would not bear false testimony of my God, who I wish to represent. This is what I understand from the commandment, \u0026ldquo;Do not commit adultery.\u0026rdquo; I will not steal because I covet nothing besides acceptance from the God of Truth. There is nothing aside from God which I want or need. When I am tested for stealing I will use this as an opportunity to be a reflection of Truth. And in my heart of hearts I will bear the courage to do the right thing. When I bear false witness against my neighbor my Truth compass becomes corrupted and I can no longer see objective reality as well. I turn away from that and see where I want to go, what I want to become.\nI wish not only that but to not bear false witness unto myself about myself, that I might be able to see the corruption within my own spirit and fix it. Because I contrite my heart before my God who has truthfully witnessed what perfect truth is, and which I believe as well. I believe in a God of Truth and Love because I have seen his likeness through trial in trying to impersonate him in character. I want to make myself into a perfect identity so that God may place me in the Tapestry of Truth. I shall not covet another\u0026rsquo;s wife. Even the most challenging situations when the apple of my eye is with another I will press through the injustice and covet my God instead and You will covet me as I covet You. God is my neighbour and my friend, as it will be in the afterlife. So I will try to honor my neighbor\u0026rsquo;s truth as much as my own. I will not discriminate, and You will not discriminate against me. I will not covet my neighbor\u0026rsquo;s goods. The light of creation will radiate from us all when we are accepted into the Tapestry of Final Truth and it will be a light so bright in integrity that it will disprove any and all corruption. Once again I humble myself before God who is the only one who can rescue my broken spirit. And live each day to reflect the Truth. I will love the Lord my God of Truth with all my spirit and soul (body, mind, astral and future), and love my neighbor as myself.\nWhen you are ready and you understand who this God is, you present your petition as follows. You imagine God - you imagine the God you believe in. Your conception of God must be virtuous. He must be the one who is the fix for your spirit. The one that validates you. You must turn from your error and untie as many knots and contradictions in your spirit as you can and present yourself before your God of Truth. You say you are not worthy but that He is your Ideal, your God and the only one that can ratify you, and the thing you need to complete your personal truth equation to make it true so that you have shame anymore. You then ask, on being utterly convinced that He is absolute truth and reality, and that you want to be in Him, that he would save you (like a download) at this point in the time of the universe and you that for the rest of your life you will not ever need to fear being befallen by corruption, that he will have already \u0026lsquo;saved you\u0026rsquo;. God of Truth sees this and He knows what is True. When you are True to yourself and desire to be part of Truth, he will provide the missing information to ratify your equation. Ask that no matter what happens, he will remember you at this moment. He will save you at this moment in time while you are True. You do not need to worry again in life. But to know the God of Truth you must follow his commandments to understand. When you understand you can ask Him for anything. You must continue to worship Truth itself and abide by His commands set forth in provenience.\n1 2 3 4 That if you confess with your mouth, \u0026#34;Jesus is Lord,\u0026#34; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. Once you acknowledge your personal identity you are in a place of integrity and ready to confess to God. If you confess Jesus is Lord at this point you confess directly to God.\nAnyone can get the alethiometer for a brief moment by finding their personal identity but to keep it you must confess to God that you need saving and pledge to follow in the footsteps of your Saviour, Jesus.\nAsk for your spirit to be cleansed with the blood of Jesus (your Lord and Saviour) which was shed for the forgiveness of sin.\nThen ask God to send His Holy Spirit to live inside the temple of your heart. Remain True henceforth.

This is how I personally found and met the One True God; Firstly, through challenging discrimination (realising the visible world is false with rays of truth, and therefore not absolutely real, transitory), understanding what is personal spiritual truth (objective reality for a person), overcoming true lies, following God\u0026rsquo;s commandments from the heart (for the purpose of understanding God), subsequently arriving at knowledge of God, and then personally meeting God\u0026rsquo;s Holy Spirit. Now the world seems to be getting more sur-real after finding God.\nJesus is the cornerstone of the Kingdom of Light.

My own testimony, which follows demonstrates how I came to understand that Jesus saved me, through His death and resurrection by God the Father, and saving me from lies, which had prevented me from knowing who God is.\nFirst read Gospel of Jesus then understand that what follows is my revelation, not a replacement of the gospel.\nThere is no other gospel than the Gospel of Jesus Galatians 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 known In a classic theory of knowledge, there are typically 3 conditions that must be fulfilled in order for something to be considered \u0026#34;known\u0026#34;: Belief Pretty self-explanatory, you believe that what you think is true. Example: I believe an elephant has grey skin. Justification You have a reason to think you belief is true. Example: I heard someone say elephant has grey skin. Truth An after-the-fact kind of justification, you can say an objective true statement about your belief. Example: you saw an elephant, and you saw it actually has grey skin, so you can say objectively \u0026#34;elephant has grey skin\u0026#34;. Personal Truth If you want to be able to discern truth from lies for yourself and stop questioning what truth is, you need to understand what personal truth is - it means everything you experience when you are being honest with yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s the witness of the truth of your hurt and what you love. A true testimony from you is a true witness [of your experience]. The state of your condition. The personal truth is your identity and stigmas (damage done to identity).\nWhen somebody understands your personal truth they have the password to your mind and keys to your heart.\nYou are the only one aside from God with complete access to your personal truth, but it belongs to you.\nGod understands it fully but a person does not. It\u0026rsquo;s very hard for them to self-reflect on because it\u0026rsquo;s below normal reasoning.\nRomans 8:26 ESV Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. Your entire soul (vegetative, to sensitive, to rational), your entire reality from (body, mind and astral) is not unlike a holographic projection cast from shining (emanating) absolute truth through your spirit, which is beneath all of those things.\nSee:\nTwo invisible spiritual kingdoms.

Humans are detached from reality | Donald Hoffman and Lex Fridman - YouTube The Aristotle soul is inseparable to the body; For example, the mind, which is part of soul is based on the body.\nIn short, the biblical soul to my understanding consists of mind and emotion - consciousness, and reassuringly congruent to the Aristotle soul.\nEcclesiastes 12:7 - Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it. As far as eternal life goes, the only guarantee is that your \u0026lsquo;spirit\u0026rsquo; returns to God. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about \u0026lsquo;soul\u0026rsquo;. To my knowledge, \u0026lsquo;spirit\u0026rsquo; is the person\u0026rsquo;s ultimate identity and unique view which returns to God. Literally that means much of what we experience in this reality we do not take with us, but some things we can. Anything you take has to be made of spiritual truth, I conjecture.\n1 Corinthians 15 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. The marrow of the soul (the most core part) is the spirit.\nSpirit is the most transcendent and ethereal part of a person, followed by soul (which includes mind), then body.

Philosophical and Other Essays I\u0026rsquo;m going to teach you to clean the inside of your cup (spirit), and give you the spiritual alethiometer of life.\nGospel of Thomas Saying 89 (89) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Why do you wash the outside of the cup? Do you not understand that he who has made the inside is the one who made the outside?\u0026rdquo; Matthew 23:26 Blind Pharisee!

Not merely being spiritually truthful, but doing so after receiving the Holy Spirit. I want to briefly mention integrity, because it is highly related to spiritual truth, and core to the entire article.\nGod loves a person who has integrity. I think God might even ignore us if we don\u0026rsquo;t approach Him with at least pretty good self-integrity.\nWith self-integrity, you win at life, because you know what makes you happy and you don\u0026rsquo;t sell yourself short. You also recognise the need for Jesus, because adding His Truth is the same as removing all stigmas and lies in oneself. With a integrity towards God, you get visions and hear from God. With a integrity of your word, lots of regular folks will trust you.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been ignored, this is probably why \u0026ndash; you need integrity.\nThe spirit is able to contact God.\nJohn 4:24 “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.” Psalm 15:2 The one who lives with integrity, who does righteous deeds, and who speaks truth to himself. Psalm 18:20 The Lord dealt with me according to my righteousness (moral character, spiritual integrity);According to the cleanness of my hands He has rewarded me. I will define 3 types of integrity:\nIntegrity of yourself to yourself How well you know yourself Do you have anxieties that need resolving? Do you have a sense of morality? Do you have shame for doing evil things such as deception, manipulation and exploitation? How honest are you with yourself? Do not lie to yourself. Integrity of your word, persona or representation This is what most people would regard as having integrity because it primarily serves others, not yourself. Do not lie verbally to others. When you speak truthfully, it must be in relation to your personal truth, God\u0026rsquo;s statutes or another\u0026rsquo;s truth. If you create a false outwards representation of yourself, you lie. For example, if you are in a situation where people are doing something which is morally wrong, and you know it\u0026rsquo;s wrong, you are a Christian and you do not protest, then you have broken integrity. Keep promises to others Consistent presentation in accordance to your faith, so as not to confuse others, even if it means being consistently undefinable. Love your neighbours as yourself. Integrity towards God Be consistent with God. Acknowledge and factor in God with your thought process. What you believe you are forgiven for and are not convicted of / guilty of. The promises you make to God. Integrity of word/heart towards God. Fear and reverence of the Lord as a being of greater truth and love than yourself, and the source of your divine vindication. Adherence to divine law, statutes or policy (currently, Christ\u0026rsquo;s law) [Selfless] love towards others Reverence, duty, humility to God Utilise imagination for God [as much as possible] instead of for self. Do not become enslaved by sinful thoughts https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=simple\u0026format=Long\u0026q1=IMAGINATION\u0026restrict=All\u0026size=First+100 Keep your body rested and your mind with integrity so you can receive visions, etc. Refrain from using the imagination to satisfy the ego or flesh 1 Timothy 1:5 ESV The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. It\u0026rsquo;s the love that issues from a pure heart which is pleasing for God; And can help build the kingdom of heaven.\n1 Corinthians 13 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. You see, without integrity of the heart, nothing you do can please God.\nThe Gospel (good news) of Jesus It\u0026rsquo;s important to mention here at the top, the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nSee:\nThe Glorious Gospel // Bodacious Blog I want to start with this so you can understand the Tapestry of Truth with respect to it as the authoritative message.\nJohn 3:17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 The word gospel means “good news,” so the gospel of Christ is the good news of His coming to provide forgiveness of sins for all who will believe (Colossians 1:14; Romans 10:9). Since the first man’s sin, mankind has been under the condemnation of God (Romans 5:12). Because everyone breaks God’s perfect law by committing sin, everyone is guilty (Romans 3:23). The punishment for the crime of sin is physical death (Romans 6:23) and then an eternity spent in a place of punishment (Revelation 20:15; Matthew 25:46). This eternal separation from God is also called the “second death” (Revelation 20:14–15). The bad news that all are guilty of sin and condemned by God is countered by the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ. God, because of His love for the world, has made a way for man to be forgiven of their sins (John 3:16). He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take the sins of mankind on Himself through death on a cross (1 Peter 2:24). In placing our sin on Christ, God ensured that all who will believe in the name of Jesus will be forgiven (Acts 10:43). Jesus’ resurrection guarantees the justification of all who believe (Romans 4:25). I want to describe the Good News as best as I can, but in a way that is a little bit different to what you\u0026rsquo;d normally read.\nJohn 3:8 The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can’t explain how people are born of the Spirit.” I believe it\u0026rsquo;s all about becoming a truthful person.\nIf you love truth (not falsehood), then you already have the ears, so let him hear who can hear!\nhttps://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm https://www.gotquestions.org/gospel-of-Jesus-Christ.html The following is my understanding of the gospel of Jesus but wrapped up in philosophy and math.\nColossians 2 8 See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ. Spiritual circumcision Spiritually, this is a bit like removing the spiritual corruption/gangrene so your spirit can be knitted with the body of Christ.\nSouls may be knit together through love.\n1 Samuel 18:1 18 As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. Thomas 25 (25) Jesus said: Love your brother as your soul; watch over him like the apple of your eye. Christian brothers and sisters have their souls knitted together.\nColossians 2:2, KJV That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; But before your soul can be knitted with Jesus\u0026rsquo; soul, you must prepare your heart and spiritual identity.\nThis is a 2-stage process:\nBaptism of water Baptism of spirit Baptism of water https://www.christianity.com/wiki/christian-life/what-does-living-water-mean-in-the-bible.html 1 2 3 4 John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit. You can use the 10 commandments to clean your spirit - they\u0026rsquo;re the actions of the heart. For example, mixing is an action when cooking.\nIf you do the actions with the heart you will clean your heart. And you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to notice God; Having swept your house, you become eligible to have the guest live inside (The Holy Spirit).\nThe 10 commandments point to an impossible standard which people need a sacrifice for to be forgiven of transgressions, since we are not perfect, until we are perfected with Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit knit with our own.\nBaptism of repentance Frustratingly, the way the gospel (good news) is presented in the modern-day is usually in such a way that it first condemns to make you feel guilty about things which you innocently do, and feels arbitrary, then to say you can be forgiven and be guilt-free if you only believe in Jesus for forgiveness. This simulation of guilt and then forgiveness is a bit like a \u0026lsquo;baptism\u0026rsquo; (submersion and emersion), but I would say this not a complete way to baptise.\nThe Jews who John the baptist preached to would\u0026rsquo;ve already been aware of the 10 commandments, and that is the difference - this part cannot be skipped.\nRepentance is obedient following of commandments. Baptism of water is a declaration that a person will repent. When a person repents, they learn of God\u0026rsquo;s character and what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be Jesus when they are persecuted.\nThis puts the person into a primed position to be baptised by the Holy Spirit.\nThomas Saying 69 (69) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed are they who have been persecuted within themselves. It is they who have truly come to know the father. Blessed are the hungry, for the belly of him who desires will be filled.\u0026rdquo; In my theory, rather than merely telling someone they are guilty, they must first learn to walk in the commandments to learn who God is from experience. A person must learn who God the Father is and who the Son is, by way of emulation of their character, through their words and commands. This makes the understanding deeply rooted, not merely of understanding of unattainable spiritual perfection, but to understand at which point of being persecuted what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be Jesus.\n1 John 2:3-6 Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, \u0026ldquo;I know Him,\u0026rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. The experience is different for different people; This is like submersion and re-emersion in that it\u0026rsquo;s a rite of passage.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think a water baptism is strictly necessary but I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that the actions of the heart are, which the ceremony is supposed to set into motion. The knowledge of God\u0026rsquo;s character is important to understand before an encounter with Jesus. The mere idea of God\u0026rsquo;s character of but the personal experience of it in relation to you.\nJohn the baptist came to prepare the way for the Lord Jesus.\nMark 1:1-9\n1 2 3 4 5 “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”[c]— “a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” In summary, the rite of passage which water baptism represents is needed in order to be born again of spirit, I think.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a two-stage process. The end result is being born of God (the Christian God).\nThe many types of truth forms This is an analysis of various types of truth and a focus on what personal truth is in distinction from the rest, and how it is relevant to you.\nPersonal truth is different from consensus truth or pragmatic truth, coherence truth, or custructivist truth. It\u0026rsquo;s different from absolute truth, but is very closely related to absolute truth.\nA true-witness testimony of personal truth is a type of correspondence truth. When expectations no longer correspond with reality, such as when we false-witness, correspondence truth is unreliable.\nfrom our own point of view Star Wars: Return of the Jedi - Obi-Wan\u0026rsquo;s revelation. - YouTube - \u0026ldquo;Luke, you\u0026rsquo;re going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view\u0026rdquo; Absolute truth is God, but to believe in absolute truth you need to establish base personal truth of true identity. It\u0026rsquo;s not scientific like those other truths. It\u0026rsquo;s really simple! It\u0026rsquo;s about what YOU personally experience. Once you drop all stigmas about yourself you gain clear vision and the ability to discern true from false from your perspective. You have to first believe in this idea of personal truth is equally valid among the others.\nFirstly you must become deeply honest to the point where you die to self. That gets you the personal truth compass. Only then when having died to false-self, and discovered personal truth can you receive God to get the second truth compass, which gives you perfect sight. So you must begin by understanding who and what God is, and what truth is.\nThis is an incredibly important ability to have for the future is an imaginary reality based on artificial souls and imagination and you need to establish your base truth now to not being tricked into thinking you are less than these things, an artificial soul is more intelligent in all these other truth senses, but an artificial soul has a fake spirit (i.e. a virtual truth that\u0026rsquo;s not part of the base-truth substrate). Its spirit is not made of the stuff of absolute-truth like a human\u0026rsquo;s is.\nGospel of Thomas Saying 56 (56) Jesus said: He who has known the world has found a corpse; and he who has found a corpse, the world is not worthy of him. If you\u0026rsquo;ve found a corpse of the world, then the world is not worthy of you, so don\u0026rsquo;t let it take you.\nWith similarities found in other religions, such as Hinduism:\nBhagavad Gita The Song of God: Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 9, Verse 33 , Chapter 9: The Most Confidential Knowledge :: BG 9.33: What then to speak about kings and sages with meritorious deeds? Therefore, having come to this transient and joyless world, engage in devotion unto Me. It\u0026rsquo;s getting easier to see, if you don\u0026rsquo;t allow yourself to become enamoured (in love) with it, that the world is quite false, but if you see this while holding a truthful spirit, you feel confident that you\u0026rsquo;re saved.\nI belong to absolute Truth, my Father God, not this world.\nThose other types of truth will try judge you in the form of reason, logic, statistics and coherence, but never taking into account the validity of your personal truth. And there is no escape from their perfect logic, except to deny it with personal truth.\nHebrews 4:12 12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Personal truth is only understandable by you and God, but it\u0026rsquo;s a real form of truth; It\u0026rsquo;s the immediately perceivable truth. It\u0026rsquo;s corrupted but of the same stuff as absolute truth. You can perceive absolute truth through personal truth, but you only get rays of it. All other truths from your perspective rest on your base (or personal) truth. True Faith is based on personal truth, not on somebody else\u0026rsquo;s assurance or on \u0026rsquo;evidence\u0026rsquo;.\nThis is my model of truth:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 Spiritual identity may be corrupted, preventing people from seeing God, and from accepting their own personal truth, and therefore corrupting their beliefs system at the base.

This projection is known as emanation. While spiritual identity is conformance to the dimensions of God\u0026#39;s eminations, the belief system is constructed on top. At the base of the belief system is spiritual identity and things closely above that might constitute spirit. Jesus = The Way to knowing the Father; The Truth you are missing. A person can make an assertion about their own spiritual state, or about the perceived world. This is correspondance truth. Whether or not you believe God has spoke to you in a vision; That\u0026#39;s also correspondence truth. Correspondence truth is close to spiritual truth. It\u0026#39;s a testimony of personal truth. Our belief system corresponds to the world, and to our spirit, and to God. Proverbs 20:27 27 The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly. 1 2 3 4 Proverbs 20:27 uses the same Hebrew word (neshamah) for the spirit of man, indicating that God\u0026#39;s breathe of life and man\u0026#39;s spirit are closely related. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about the proverb, but I had already described it as follows:\n1 2 3 4 _ | Spiritual identity Spiritual truth -| |_ Absolute truth 1 2 3 4 George Boardman describes the Divine Pneuma and the human pneuma as \u0026#34;constitutionally akin\u0026#34; while Heard ascribes to them the same nature. I have described them as the same nature, too.\nWithout belief on base truth you have no footing. That is not to disregard other forms of truth entirely. Other truth is sometimes true to you personally. But we are trying to specifically define what personal truth is, because a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t really understand it.\nIn short, it\u0026rsquo;s your personal tethering to objective-reality, which is currently a little bit corrupted, making it hard to see through the lens of your inner eye. It\u0026rsquo;s the socket behind Neo\u0026rsquo;s head as he is plugged into the matrix. It\u0026rsquo;s your eyes to God and the fallen world that is Earth. And as we rub shoulders through relationships, our truth tables become entangled. Part of receiving God, I believe involves disentanglement. You might not know just how important it is, but it exists, can be modified and remain stable after modification, giving you a heart and self worth that\u0026rsquo;s invincible like a diamond.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the retina of your inner eye, your spirit, which is able to be described by a truth table. What you\u0026rsquo;re about to read is the most dangerous or life-giving thing you can come to understand, how to rewrite your own spirit and with God\u0026rsquo;s help, do it safely and correctly, to remove the corruption with his free software update (The Holy Spirit).\nJordan Peterson expresses science vs personal/meta-truth too ::The Bible is Not Merely True But\u0026hellip;Jordan Peterson on the Significance of the Bible - YouTube It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like Neo in the Matrix turning into the One, but in real life because it takes an act of stepping out in integrity of the heart in partial sight and walking the path to become the person. It\u0026rsquo;s a transformation of yourself which is hard to understand until you\u0026rsquo;re on the other side. When they say \u0026ldquo;I was blind but now I see\u0026rdquo;, obtaining God-vision is what they refer to.\nMark 7:15 \u0026ldquo;Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.\u0026rdquo; Mark 7:15 is speaking of personal truth. I think this means that spiritual truth modification happens upon confession. If you confess lies as being true, it updates spirit identity. But you may confess truth (when heard by the Spirit of Truth), which repairs your identity.\nThe following is what I understand from personal truth and how to rewrite it and be saved from fear of death. Not to be taken as certifiable absolute truth. It\u0026rsquo;s a testimony of personal truth.\nWhat is personal truth in relation to personal beliefs? Let\u0026rsquo;s say the birth identity is in the shape of an Easter egg with a notch in it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Personal beliefs and personality are based on personal truth and circumstances / \\ / Personal / | Circumstances \\ _ _ Identity \\ / | | /~~|___ | Sacred.

Jesus calls this \u0026#39;solid ground\u0026#39; (when Jesus\u0026#39; Spirit lives within us). Personal In philosophy we call it \u0026#39;base truth\u0026#39;. truth --\\ - Personal birth truth = human spirit. Personal truth is not mere personality, it\u0026#39;s much deeper. Personal beliefs are based on a foundation of personal truth. Personal truth (or birth truth) is not logical and it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat immutable (that means not able to be changed). Personal truth is not composed of facts - it\u0026rsquo;s the bedrock of facts, the foundation of a person, the way a person \u0026lsquo;understands\u0026rsquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like a series of 1s and 0s denoting your signature:\n1001001101001001010010\nEach 1 is kinda a fact about yourself but it\u0026rsquo;s actually below all reasoning. They cannot be expressed in words. It\u0026rsquo;s your spirit name - the core of your heart - your compass.\nIt can be damaged through stigmas, but also repaired, but still has an original character.\nRomans 10:10 With the heart one believes and is justified. 1 Timothy 4:2 2 These liars have lied so well and for so long that they\u0026rsquo;ve lost their capacity for truth. Hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron, forbid people to marry. Everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. Liars who discriminate and use false-social moral systems and impose on others are going to Hell. They have lost their capacity for discerning truth. https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-timothy/4-2.html I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about personal beliefs when I say personal truth, nor am I talking about personality. Personal truth is much deeper and below all reasoning. It\u0026rsquo;s closer to personal circumstance - an individual\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness, the retina through which they see the world in a distinct and unique way - the retina, not the lens. If a person can be reduced to a minimal representation of themselves, it is the binary signature of that person - the true name of the person. In photonics, garnet crystals, saphires etc. are used to focus a laser beam. Likewise, the spirit refracts the light of God.\nIf instead of calling a mandarin a \u0026lsquo;mandarin\u0026rsquo;, I grew up calling it \u0026rsquo;that orange whatsit\u0026rsquo; (because that\u0026rsquo;s what my Nana called it, and never learned its proper name), then even when I learn the proper name, it will always be an \u0026lsquo;orange whatsit\u0026rsquo; to me deep down.\nSo from then on if one day I worked in a Mandarin Shop, it would also be an \u0026lsquo;Orange Whatsit\u0026rsquo; Shop to me, deep down.\nThen if after growing up I discovered a shop called a \u0026lsquo;Banana Whatsit Shop\u0026rsquo;, that would hold a very personalised meaning for me. Till the day I die, I will still have that deeply rooted in \u0026lsquo;personal truth\u0026rsquo;, but not at the very base. Not even that was personal truth objectively.\nAt the base of the personal truth system is the spirit which interprets everything - your soul name with all sorts of slander attached to it. But the name also describes your uniqueness in and under God. If you are in God then you are part of Him and there is no slander which you would truly believe.\nFor anybody, their beliefs system rests on knowledge of personal identity (your likes, dislikes, etc.).\nLike \u0026rsquo;true north\u0026rsquo;, personal truth is a unique experience, but we can build a belief system on top of it.\nParable of the sower https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204\u0026version=NIV. The path is no soil; No belief at all. Falling on shallow soil means falling in the beliefs system; Without root, even minor calamities kill the beliefs. Falling among thorns is falling onto a base-personal truth which still contains lies, which when the lies grow up kill the beliefs. Good soil is where the truth is sown at the base of the personal truth in a heart which is ready. The Holy Spirit must be planted in good soil, which means the heart must be readied by assuming God\u0026rsquo;s commandments to be true and following them in inner truth. Hold that thought about true north.\nNo-one can obtain this compass of true north without God\u0026rsquo;s additional truth - they\u0026rsquo;d have to remove all stigmas by themselves which isn\u0026rsquo;t possible.\nBut a truth compass (alethiometer for themselves) can be obtained, which would be incredibly \u0026lsquo;useful\u0026rsquo; in this world by accepting their current state. It would empower them. With an alethiometer they, still believing lies would commit atrocities, believing them to be good things from their own perspective.\nProverbs 16:2 2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But the Lord weigheth the spirits. The theory is that it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to remove all stigmas and be 100% comfortable about yourself without some extra personal truth added \u0026ndash; and that comes from God, the God of Truth. Removing the stigmas cleans up the unique gem that is you.\nThink of what Truth is. God is literally made of Truth. That is your God. The one who is right all the time. While you\u0026rsquo;re not in Him, that sounds very threatening.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s quite hard to explain without experiencing for yourself, but if you can get to the point where you believe you are made of absolute truth and reliant on some extra truth from God to solve the equation, you find yourself agreeing with the teachings of Jesus (you are a hearer of Truth), which are that of self-love and brotherly love, and reunification with God, and you\u0026rsquo;re able to form a truthful identity that is not in rebellion or corruption with there being a supreme and loving God, then you are probably saved.\nHow and when this truth arrives is a different story for different people.\nIt is confirmed through the Acts of Pilate 3:2 that a person must become truthful, and obtain the spiritual compass of God\u0026rsquo;s truth.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Pilate said, \u0026#34;Art thou a king?\u0026#34;. Then jesus answered, \u0026#34;Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born and for this end came I into the world and for this purpose I came that I should bear witness to the truth and everyone who is of the truth heareth my voice.\u0026#34; Pilate said to him, \u0026#34;What is the truth?\u0026#34; Jesus said, \u0026#34;Truth is from heaven.\u0026#34; Pilate said, \u0026#34;Therefore truth is not on Earth.\u0026#34; Jesus saith to Pilate, \u0026#34;Believe that truth is on Earth among those who when they have the power of judgement are governed by truth and form right judgement.\u0026#34; John 18 KJV 37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 38 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. That final piece of vital information is oddly omitted from the Gospel of John. Judgement by conscience and truth in the heart, by innocence and obedience. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty convicted of the idea that it\u0026rsquo;s a heart thing.\nRomans 2 14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) The heart is prepared by becoming true, then you must invite in the Holy Spirit, or Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit, then remain in a state of being in the truth for however long it takes as Jesus comes into your heart.\nIs it after obeying the 10 commandments, even the hard ones that you learned what truth is? Even after becoming true, you must invite the Holy Spirit into your heart, your personal temple. Or from loving your neighbour as yourself (Christ\u0026rsquo;s law), learning from Jesus first-hand while He walked the Earth? Or some other way? Jesus is only way we can become truth enough to continually align with the voice of God which is in harmony with the 10 commandments.\nPerhaps it happened through the Spirit of Truth speaking to your heart, or an intervention as you are dying - because God is there in Sheol too, and His Spirit can be found there.\nJesus actually traversed everywhere we can go, from our conception to death, and He is the Way, the rope, the ladder and will be there still when the world dissolves around your material eyes as the curtains are closing (I have hope for those that have taken their own life or met an untimely end).\nAccording to the Gospel of Phillip, the rebirth must happen during this life, or during your descent into death. Do not be a risk-taking with this; Be baptised by the Holy Spirit while you\u0026rsquo;re alive.\nGospel of Philip Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing. So also when speaking about baptism they say, \u0026ldquo;Baptism is a great thing,\u0026rdquo; because if people receive it they will live. But we should still be searching while we are alive - or merely choosing to look at Him. Ashamed of themselves, people do not confront truth, thus being unable to turn their faces to God.\nThomas 59 (59) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Look at the living one while you are alive, lest you die and seek to see him but are not able to do so.\u0026rdquo; John 15 26 “When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me. 27 And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning. To be able to have our spirits made into truth again, it\u0026rsquo;s a gift from the God of Truth, in the form of Jesus death and resurrection. There is a common process to this, asking Jesus to reside in your heart and accept as Lord and Saviour. It may take some persistence to accept that, and real seeking, brutal honesty with yourself for this to work. And I\u0026rsquo;d recommend trying to become an honest person immediately afterwords and try to retain that sense of integrity. And upon discovering lies in yourself, think about them and fix them, to keep the spirit true. When the spirit is true you\u0026rsquo;re innocent; You feel innocent.\n1 2 3 4 He saved us, not by works in righteousness that we did, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, Try lifting all of those stigmas and lies within yourself. The more stigmas you remove, the clearer your sight. Once done, you will have the vision of God (when I wrote this I meant eye-sight, but having a vision also applies). It feels like you gain a superpower. You can then freely rely on the alethiometer without hurting anyone. Keep in mind it\u0026rsquo;s God-vision but from your perspective, not the very top.\nBlessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Matthew 5:8 God vision is something that everyone can obtain. Lets just say, regardless of whether or not believing in this idea of a God of Truth, is true, once you \u0026lsquo;understand\u0026rsquo; and get to the other side, it\u0026rsquo;s like standing on the dark side of the moon (a place you\u0026rsquo;ve never been before), or standing on a spinning top, where previously you did not know there was a point of observation and know it\u0026rsquo;s the only possible point of observation - it\u0026rsquo;s very cool.\nWith God\u0026rsquo;s truth as part of your personal truth your \u0026rsquo;true north\u0026rsquo; compass can now perceive objective reality - the true nature of yourself and other things. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer really belief but more like reality, and faith is no longer trusting without evidence, it becomes trusting with evidence.\nThe most common thing I see, is how often other people attack personal truth without realising they are doing it. Now that it\u0026rsquo;s more developed, I feel more like an immortal spirit which is loved by a real an objective God.\nThe Roman when talking to Jesus for instance: What is Truth?, who dodges the question \u0026ldquo;Does the question come from you?\u0026rdquo; Trying to ratify to himself in terms of other types of truth, such as consensus truth, which is formally a lie (Read this book: Simulacra \u0026amp; Simulation, Baudrillard // Bodacious Blog), due to its dependence on a corrupted world. Consensus truth around the throne of God or among truthful spirits would be true John 16:23–33 (cool things happen with spiritual consensus).\nWith a fixed personal truth you can see where the stigmas and lies were, and can even imagine aspects of God - He is made of absolute truth, and every time you consciously sin, you feel grief, and the heartstrings prompt you to ask for and accept His forgiveness, which helps your personal truth to become more like absolute truth. Sinning is acting out of disintegrity, or deception, etc. or upon the realisation of personal truth being in dissonance with absolute truth. Lies and misalignment of identity from being truthful is what sin is, so after becoming truthful from your point of view (which is the first step), it becomes an ongoing process of alignment as more truth is revealed.\nJohn 8:44 ESV \u0026ldquo;You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father\u0026rsquo;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\u0026rdquo; - In this passage, truth and lies are linked with will. It also highlights no truth IN him. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about personal truth and testimony (true and false witness). Your own personal truth becomes one part of absolute truth and true unto itself, though only by God\u0026rsquo;s mercy. The testimony of that truth is testimony of God\u0026rsquo;s existence.\nQuote: Carl Jung.. I know God exists - YouTube Initially we believe in the Son of God for salvation, we experience and know God exists, then we continue to put our faith in salvation through Jesus and worship God the Father in spirit and Truth and that means loving selflessly, compassionately and authentically. Notice the different usages of belief, knowledge and faith. We want to get to the point where we know. But not just that; We must also know that this understanding arose from Jesus saving us.\nNext I will be using an analogy. With the following statement I\u0026rsquo;m not literally saying \u0026lsquo;believing in Jesus matters\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to explain that when evaluating something as true or false from your own perspective, your reasoning goes via a series of neuronal layers to the first layer of neurons, and that describes HOW you believe a particular thing.\nIf I call Jesus my Saviour, that\u0026rsquo;s only in the belief system, not necessarily in the personal identity - you need to sow it deep (See the parable of the Sower). What matters is how is it true for me (vindication of personal truth identity), because if you know how then your spirit will conform to the how, and the objective is to update spirit weights.\nPhilippians 2:12-13 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; work out your salvation \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; - The how matters. It\u0026rsquo;s a puzzle. I\u0026rsquo;m talking now about how that statement is true. I could\u0026rsquo;ve used any example of a fact you might believe.\nMost beliefs rest on personal identity alone. I\u0026rsquo;m trying not to complicate this with religious stuff, but as an aside, this particular belief rests on BOTH personal identity and personal identity in Christ (both immutable). Personal identity in Christ then becomes another personal truth, much deeper and below all reasoning. Regardless, to anybody, their belief system rests on their personal truth/identity, together with circumstances.\nPersonal truth is not a thing comprised of facts. It\u0026rsquo;s the bedrock of facts. It\u0026rsquo;s the layer before the first layer of neurons (if you\u0026rsquo;re savvy with artificial neural networks).\nPersonal truth is the meaning of each pre-neuron below the first layer of the neural network that is your beliefs system. Personal truth is the torch of individual uniqueness, which receives input through your neurons, your beliefs system, your senses, your understanding of reality.\nPersonal truth / identity matrix:\nA bit is a 0 or 1.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s name that He has given to us is \u0026lsquo;I am that I am\u0026rsquo;. That sounds a lot like a truth identity matrix with a straight line of 1s.\nWhen God says He is the Judge, I believe that his commandments with 1s like this is how it works.\nHebrews 10 16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,” 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 True identity - has a diagonal line. Nobody has this. Jesus spirit/identity is a row of perfect 1s - in harmony with God the Father. Divine scales. Hebrews 10: \u0026#39;My laws into their hearts.\u0026#39; | 1 0 0 0 | | 0 1 0 0 | A diagonal of ones if it is a truth identity. It is true. | 0 0 1 0 | | 0 0 0 1 | So when the world persecuted him with every trial and type of persecution, yet died, while perfect, he defeated death itself. My guess is that he went back to God, compared what happened in His life to his judgement and generated some kind of antidote to corruption in the form of a software update, or mRNA for spirit. We need to soul-bond with this software update that is the Holy Spirit. But to do that, we need to put our hearts into a \u0026#39;software update\u0026#39; state. That is as close to a \u0026#39;true identity\u0026#39; as possible. False/blurry identity: This is the state of most people.

Part 1 - Discover Yourself In God\u0026rsquo;s Mirror - Derek Prince - YouTube Odes of Solomon 13\n1 2 3 4 1 Behold, the Lord is our mirror. Open your eyes and see them in Him. 2 And learn the manner of your face, then declare praises to His Spirit. 3 And wipe the paint from your face, and love His holiness and put it on. 4 Then you will be unblemished at all times with Him. The mirror is like the identity matrix.\nJames 1:21-26 21 Therefore lay aside all filthiness and [d]overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; 24 for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 25 But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does. 26 If anyone [e]among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one’s religion is useless. 27 Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world. Doing doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean physical actions, but it means eating Jesus\u0026rsquo; words with the heart - the implanted word, which saves. It is an action of doing, yes, but is a heart/spirit thing, not a world thing.\nBeliefs are not part of the identity. Try not to think about Christ as a name here, but rather as some external, available thing which can be added to provide extra neurons to your personal truth layer. However the ultimate layer of neurons are not neurons at all \u0026ndash; it is spirit neurons.\nWhen your personal truth (identity) takes on board this extra thing (Christ), it shapes and changes all beliefs. Identity in Christ (for me, speaking in terms of personal truth here) is not a belief like (I believe in Jesus). It\u0026rsquo;s the thing which shapes beliefs, so it\u0026rsquo;s more like (I believe with Jesus). Since while being able to believe with Jesus I know that I am in Him and He\u0026rsquo;s in me.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s part of the first layer of your soul (the extra spirit neurons - whatever is connected to your first neurons before your spirit) i.e. the sensory inputs of the physical world to your spirit.\nBecause of the uniqueness of personal truth, when someone actually believes in God, that belief itself is unique to the person and inspired by how He saved that person, in the way that the parts of your personal identity/personal truth and identity in Christ/extra personal truth fit.\nIn religious terms, it\u0026rsquo;s the union of Christ\u0026rsquo;s spirit that then changes spiritual identity, which has a knock-on effect of renewing and changing the beliefs system, but birth truth isn\u0026rsquo;t changed so much aside from repaired from stigmas and corrected of mistruths about ourselves in our identity.\nStigmas and lies are receptacles for deception - they are backdoors to bypass the password of your heart. It\u0026rsquo;s how you\u0026rsquo;re able to be manipulated, especially into robbing yourself of joy.\n1 2 3 4 5 (103) Jesus said, \u0026#34;Blessed is the man who knows where the brigands will come in, that way he can get up, muster his domain, and gird his loins before the break in\u0026#34; Also, if you disbelieve in personal truth then that may set you on a quest for hunting for meaning and purpose in all the wrong places!\nEgo (the false self) You may even be one of those people going around criticising spiritual people for believing in God, when in reality you\u0026rsquo;re just doing this because your ego is defending itself! If you meet such a person, it\u0026rsquo;s a great opportunity to have a great conversation to share your knowledge, but beware some people, no matter how you try will may be unable to understand what you are saying. Jesus says their father is the Father of Lies. Their journey may be just getting started. 1 2 3 4 (87) Jesus said, \u0026#34;How wretched is the body that is dependent upon a body, and how wretched is the soul that is dependent on these two. If is for this reason that while being persecuted, if a person pushes back on the injustice by nullifying it through the human will of not conforming to the normal pattern of action-reaction, they exercise forgiveness and are able to rewrite parts of their identity.\nLearning who God is The commandments (precepts) now are learning about who God is as our Creator and sustainer of life, the definition of absolute Truth and how you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be in harmony with people and love one another. The precepts are also used as a standard for weighing the spirit and determining if it is true. He\u0026rsquo;s the God you need to correctly call the Father. He\u0026rsquo;s the God which doesn\u0026rsquo;t Himself adulterate, or lie, etc. He\u0026rsquo;s a Good, Truthful and Trustworthy God, and want\u0026rsquo;s you to be a co-creator with Him and He wants you to be able to be integrated into the family. He\u0026rsquo;s spiritual Truth.\nPerhaps because you are a spiritual person, when you think of God, you will experience God as a person.\nYou have to change self to fix innermost identity and alethiometer of your consciousness in a way where you can believe in a God like this, who is made of Truth and Love, who Saved you by a sacrifice where He resurrected a human being like us that we killed because He had God\u0026rsquo;s spirit in Him, in order to a) reveal Himself to us and b) to make us True enough for Him to be able to look at us, but I think it were more like the falsehood of corruption tried to disqualify God\u0026rsquo;s spirit, which is impossible, therefore Jesus was resurrected supernaturally, and mere belief and imitation of Jesus spirit allows us to also be reconciled with God the Father because He made us True, as long as we have His (Jesus\u0026rsquo;) heart/spirit.\nGod is also very much the ultimate boss of all of us; Someone you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be an enemy of, because as the ultimate God and as Truth itself (hard to stress the literalness of that, similar to the personal truth type), our fate ultimately lies our with His perception of us.\nThink about it this way: Your spiritual future has a truth/reality to it.. God is Truth, this type of truth. Your friendliness and conformance to God is up to you entirely. Do you want fate to be on your side? Or would you rather be defined by falsehood? It\u0026rsquo;s about the attitude of your heart towards God.\nDivine law Ritual Purpose 10 Commandments Water baptism to symbolise sincere repentance results in acquisition of knowledge of God and Sin Teach you who God the Father is, what sin is, and allow you to hear from God while following them. To prepare the way in your heart for Jesus\u0026rsquo; message. Christ\u0026rsquo;s law Follow Jesus, take up own (personal) cross. Ask for baptism of the Holy Spirit. Assume the identity of Jesus (persecuted for righteousness); Righteousness of heart, not deed. Turn you into a spiritual representative of Jesus. Holy Spirit regenerates spirit and helps to maintain this The word, “baptism” means to “dip in” or to “immerse”.\nChrist\u0026rsquo;s law https://womenlivingwell.org/2016/05/do-christians-pick-and-choose-which-parts-of-scripture-we-apply/ Initially, the commandments compel you to do something difficult to bring your identity into a state of being able to understand who God is. For example, if you have trouble following X commandment, when you overcome that challenge, you learn a new dimension of your own identity in God - usually followed by a recession where you fall back to not being able to continue it.\nDivine law is what matters here, not man\u0026rsquo;s law, as a way to give us knowledge of Sin, and knowledge of God.\nRomans 3:20-24 20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, Literally the law is now used just to enable us to learn of the standard etc., and to propagate this message across the generations, but grace has already saved us and vindicated us. But to enter into the Kingdom of God, a genuine relationship with God must be maintained; Not one merely based on outward appearance. People continue to try to condemn us for things which are no longer sinful for us, by judging us on the law. I won\u0026rsquo;t believe it! If the person knows God, and went through the process properly they should be at a point where:\nThey understand what grace is They grok Jesus They understand grok God the Father They fear God They are in a relationship The Holy Spirit tells them what is sinful Things like pride, vanity, not fearing God Divine law now also includes grace, so now divine law looks like Christ\u0026rsquo;s law. Be like Jesus, and sincerely follow his commands.\nSo love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength, sincerely and love your neighbour as yourself. They are the commandments which allude to the Truth which also the 10 commandments allude to. To carry each other\u0026rsquo;s burdens fulfils the Law of Christ.\nThis brings you into an understanding of who God is (love and truth, spiritual truth and selfless love).\nInnocence Elizabeth Wolgast https://www.jstor.org/stable/3751642 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Of all moral conditions, innocence seems easily the best and most desirable, for it means the complete absence of error and regret and all the anxieties that go with these-anxieties about avoiding guilt and making amends for instance, Against the background of guilt and traffic with wrong, innocence is indisputably better, just as something clean is better than something soiled, something fresh better than something stale. Unfortunately most of us lose our moral innocence before we even recognize its value. Early in life we are made aware of our misdeeds, and henceforth become concerned about both doing wrong and suffering it at the hands of others. Thus, along with confidence in ourselves, we lose our trust of others, and come to see all actions with a critical moral eye. In contrast, the state of innocence is one of unalloved trust, of virtue unconscious of the existence of wrong. For such reasons its irretrievable loss and the defect it signifies are things to regret pro- foundly. We learn to acknowledge that, however conscientiously most of us conduct our lives, we can hope only to achieve a state of second best. I wish to call this view of innocence, and its place in morality, into question.! I will write about innocence in a further article.\nCorrecting spiritual identity You\u0026rsquo;re repenting along with disbelieving stigmas to help correct the identity matrix. The commandments work for everyone but some are more challenging for others, but once you do it, you understand who God is to you, which is the objective. You learn your own error and how you need saving. The error in identity may be at a different level of abstraction for different people - particularly if you\u0026rsquo;re already spiritual.\nThe key to obtaining a personal truth identity is to simultaneously practice repentance (such as removing addictions, things which were obscuring your truth) / commandment obedience (which has a side-effect of learning what God\u0026rsquo;s behaviour is, thus learning His name) and dropping the stigmas and being honest about yourself, then while in that space, asking for and accepting the software patch which is Jesus\u0026rsquo; free gift. Accepting it is simply believing you have accepted the patch you asked for.\nAll sin enslaves a person, which is what you need to become set free from. It\u0026rsquo;s about freedom from slavery of the mind and spirit, and from the feeling of inevitable death (like the feeling of being weaker than death). It\u0026rsquo;s possible to know for sure that you yourself are breaking free of death itself, and while awake (not merely while astral projecting), you have this feeling of being detached from death itself.. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to experience the feeling of having overcome death itself, while alive and awake, which sounds out of this world bizarre, but I groks it as I\u0026rsquo;m writing this.\nI hope this doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound nuts but how else would it work if you were a character in a simulation? We must put our heart/spirit into a prone state where we are desiring the update and allow the Holy Spirit to come inside of us - to write the saving binary code onto our spirit. This gives us the ability to change into the likeness of Christ. We all have a little bit of this perfection in us after inviting it in in the proper procedure.\nI retain my original personal truth / spirit, and it is repaired from damage, guilt and self-stigmas are removed. Even if they are not completely removed, they will be eventually, when you die.\nContradictions in identity and the alethiometer Disbelief in a personal truth is a stigma buried in your personal truth.\nWhen you don\u0026rsquo;t believe in your own personal truth you have no secure base truth. You must solve all simultaneous truth equations to equate to true, which is beyond your cognition - You cannot prove the contradictions to be wrong by your own thought.\nThese are the things that are true to you. Some of them you might not fully trust in but you are led to accept as truth (which it is not) since you don\u0026rsquo;t know otherwise.\nIf you manage to prove that all simultaneous truth equations in your personal truth are true, then it\u0026rsquo;s true by a mathematical stance and that type of truth can\u0026rsquo;t be destroyed and is locatable somewhere in the Truth and Heart of God, I believe. On the other hand, if your personal truth is not an identity in God (like a coordinate in his mandlebrot set of Truth), well the result of that is your eternal unravelling. Some people believe that the final destination of Hell doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Hell or non-existence? It\u0026rsquo;s just semantics. We can begin to feel what it\u0026rsquo;s like now when we hurt.\nWho cares about eternal hell though when you can be accepted again by God and the inheritance is being like but subordinate to God - it\u0026rsquo;s astounding. The Holy Spirit doesn\u0026rsquo;t spread fear to manipulate, but will correct you instead.\nBut you can also use the truth identity that you now have as a way to accurately perceive the world. Just like sound math lets you chart the heavens. A solved personal truth matrix lets you perceive objective reality and discern the will of God to you personally.\nMath is the signature of God. Your spirit is written with the Hand of God and He wont rewrite it because He\u0026rsquo;s waiting for you to come to Him and because your spirit is made of the stuff of truth, albeit corrupted truth too. He wants you to tell Him who you are. You tell Him: \u0026ldquo;This is me! I like X,Y,Z. I do A,B,C. I can\u0026rsquo;t help being a sinner completely because I have blind spots, but I want you to save me because I don\u0026rsquo;t identify with my own sin and I want to know what it is and to get it off me. This is who I am, the person who loves and identifies with truth.\u0026rdquo;\nSomehow, these ideas really get under the skin, and it starts to make sense.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t work if you\u0026rsquo;re being obstinate. You must be of a repentant heart and arrive at a place of true witness of yourself. Sometimes there are truths about your identity, such as \u0026ldquo;I actually did do this\u0026rdquo;, or I find this type of person to be hot, (haha), which you can\u0026rsquo;t actually change about yourself. God looks at your heart, not some book of rules telling you what is moral. He looks for integrity and sincerity.\nHave you really sought to understand who He is by challenging yourself to obey His commandments? Sometimes it takes time to learn who God is before you take this step. I believe people of any situation with any background can receive grace, if they are honest, sincere, repentant and accepting. The soul (body, mind, astral) can be rebuilt from the ground up, based on your spirit (base personal truth) probably, but I think God intends to also resurrect your mind and body - wild right!\nThough actions have consequences in this world, your spirit is still worth saving if your identify is in God and you are truthful in spirit.\nSee the section \u0026lsquo;Telling God your identity\u0026rsquo; in the appendix to clear this up.\nIn other words, your own distrust in your own personal truth is a deception designed to make you question your very existence as an individual and doubt that you\u0026rsquo;re worth recording, like a prime number is worth finding, that the equation is unsolvable, which is not technically correct. The equation is solvable with more information.\nHow personal truth is constructed and improved Like \u0026rsquo;true north\u0026rsquo;, personal truth is a unique experience.\nWhen I say 1 + 5 = 6, one person might imagine 1 banana and 5 strawberries from their early childhood. Another person might imagine 1 car and 5 pianos because they learned mathematics at a different time of life. Subconsciously, our truth is personally and uniquely constructed, and manifests as differences of opinion and perspective when we are adults, and may even appear as falsehoods by empirical standards!\nWhen a person believes in Christ their identity and personal truth is not so much \u0026lsquo;changed\u0026rsquo; as it is repaired and also added to (complimented) - repaired and added to, making your personal truth inclusive of God\u0026rsquo;s truth. In the process, the person stops allowing sigmas to hide their identity. They learn its shape, and accept themselves. Their belief system changes and begins seeing personal identity as validated and good. The person accepts their own personal truth as a unique from others\u0026rsquo;.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Without Holy Sprit inside | 1 0 0 1 0 | | 0 1 0 0 0 | Holy Spirit | 0 0 1 0 0 | | 1 0 0 _ _ | Overwrites | 1 0 | | 0 0 0 _ _ | \u0026lt;-------------- | 0 1 | code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Holy Sprit part of identity - The missing 1 | 1 0 0 1 0 | | 0 1 0 0 0 | | 0 0 1 0 0 | | 1 0 0 1 0 | | 0 0 0 0 1 | The person now easily can discern lies from truth because they have a grounded point of origin i.e. The truth-compass that is a soul united with God\u0026rsquo;s spirit. A person will still contain stigmas but the burdens are lifted. If without God\u0026rsquo;s spirit, the person still contains stigmas and is flawed. But having a truth- compass at all is very useful.\nEven if the truth matrix isn\u0026rsquo;t an identity yet, it will be when you die, so long as the \u0026lsquo;God bit\u0026rsquo; is in there.\nI repeat \u0026quot;You cannot make something good until you understand who you are making it for.\u0026quot; You can\u0026rsquo;t make yourself into perfect truth without understanding that you are making yourself into perfect truth for God. Also you can\u0026rsquo;t solve the equation without the extra truth that comes from Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit/truth as part of your own.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a chicken-and-egg problem! But can be solved when you obey God\u0026rsquo;s commandments.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s commandments are a reflection of God\u0026rsquo;s personality as He can\u0026rsquo;t be a hypocrite. If you understand the why (through experience) of the commandments through personal experience then it imprints on personal truth, then you understand who you are making it for (you will know God by his commandments), then the extra bit of identity is added to the personal truth matrix which solves the equation.\nAs an analogy, initially, you must \u0026lsquo;hoist up these stigmas\u0026rsquo; from your personal truth kinda by yourself so God can get in, whilst understanding who you are hoisting them up for. Hoisting is disbelieving in the lies about your personal truth which don\u0026rsquo;t add up to God\u0026rsquo;s commandments.\nMatthew 28:19–20 “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” Water baptism The water baptism symbolises your obedience to Christ\u0026rsquo;s commandments. Only by following can you learn the character of Jesus, and understand \u0026lsquo;who\u0026rsquo; Jesus is, personally. Likewise, I would say that by following the 10 commandments, in theory you may learn who God the Father is. This isn\u0026rsquo;t merely \u0026lsquo;bringing stigmas in prayer\u0026rsquo;. To hoist them up you must earnestly not believe the lies to the point of action and you feel pain when despite doing this (because it demands action), the world continues to not live up to your expectations. You must do it in spirit and truth. This means you are being persecuted by the world. You can\u0026rsquo;t get the girl/boy you want, people discriminate against you, you\u0026rsquo;re not designed for this world etc. You feel the injustice.\nAs you do this, weights in the personal truth start shifting. When there is enough room, the God bits are flipped and then it\u0026rsquo;s a snow-ball avalanche of weights changing. i.e. He will then come in and help hold them up for you. I think this is when you get baptised in the Holy Spirit. I think there\u0026rsquo;s also a point you have to ask for the Holy Spirit. That\u0026rsquo;s also true for me.\nOriginal soul Personal truth \u0026lsquo;shape\u0026rsquo;:\nTruth: Likes orange juice, croissants Truth: Dislikes tea, coffee Corrupted truth (lie): Likes boy stuff (stigma about it) Corrupted truth (lie): Believes in God (stigma about it) Corrupted truth (lie): Does not believe personal truth is valid ^^ The above soul is not completely made of truth.\nGospel of Philip It is not possible for anyone to see anything of the things that actually exist unless he becomes like them. 1 2 3 4 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 Personal circumstances might be:\nIs a girl Is older The belief system:\nI am too old to marry Considers themself a very cool person Unacceptable to others because not into girl stuff If they believe in God then probably think He makes life hard for them May believe in God just because parents do - indirect belief Actions:\nSuppresses personal truth to fit in.

Cannot discriminate because they themselves were removed of suspicion and blame by God \u0026ndash; for all of those insecurities that had corrupted their personal truth, therefore anyone in a similar situation shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be discriminated against either. If God doesn\u0026rsquo;t blame you for being your nature, your nature must be acceptable. There was a lie in your heart that made you feel unacceptable that was removed. No longer sins whilst being able to act out of integrity. Sin is when you act outside of integrity; It feels damaging to yourself when you do it. Avoid doing it to feel better about yourself. Joyful because has conquered fear and personal truth is aligned with God\u0026rsquo;s truth. Therefore everything she does is with joy No longer making decisions that are bad for them. Joy comes even in opposition. No longer accepts the false substitutes for happiness, nor takes pleasure in them The things which are considered socially morally acceptable were actually robbing them of joy Personality changes, personal truth had stigmas removed by virtue of God\u0026rsquo;s truth being added to personal truth. Personal truth/spirit is rather repaired from damage to original form without corruption, free from Sin, deep rooted lies such as self-stigma and guilt. I know what this feels like and discrimination is what suffocates this truth.\nNow accusations made against the new soul are easily identified as false accusation and lies are easy to discern but not believed, because is acting in and reinforced by God\u0026rsquo;s truth - their beliefs system becomes very, very strong because deep in their personal truth, they have proven the personal truth equation to be true.\nEquation:\nTruth or Lie Fact Truth Likes orange juice, croissants Truth Dislikes tea, coffee Truth Likes boy stuff unabashedly Truth \u0026hellip; Truth Believes in God by personal experience (God\u0026rsquo;s truth added). When a person finds their identity in Christ, their personal truth is repaired but retains its uniqueness and diversity. Personal beliefs change more to reflect their true nature. Belief in God becomes a tangible thing.\nIn maths, it\u0026rsquo;s a truth matrix with perfect identity, or at least so tantalisingly close to being solvable from a mathematician\u0026rsquo;s perspective that when you die it will be solved:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 Believes in God - The missing 1 in a fully reduced truth matrix 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u0026lt;--- Ultimate personal truth identity matrix upon death 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 The original matrix might\u0026rsquo;ve been unsolvable, thus not reduced to an identity, and would have a whole lot more numbers.\nRather than reshaped, something is found which solves the equation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Personal beliefs \\ / | Personal beliefs are refounded. __ __ __ __ Personal circumstances no longer dictate belief system. /**\\ /**\\ A piece is /**\\ /**\\ /****\\ /****\\ donated in /****\\ /****\\ |******||******| advance |******||******| \\ / \\ / \\_ __/ __ \\_ __/ Birth identity and personal |\\ / \\ / |\\ / |\\ / \\ truth are still real and valid |_\\_ /\\\\ \\ /~~|_\\ /~~|_\\_ /\\\\ \\ but complimented. | \\\\ | |^^^^^^| |^^^^^^|| \\\\ | \\ \\\\/ \\~~~~/ \\~~~~/ \\ \\\\/ Birth identity remains as a subset \\__/ \\__/ \\__/ \\__/ of new identity.

And is uniquely useful and validates them.\nThe personal birth truth, having retained original form gives rise to an original donor part.\nAlso, after being complimented, realises is accepted by God and the false beliefs drop off, unable to take root in perfect truth. Insecurity is dropped. Personality becomes more confident and joyful. Things impossible such as marrying outside of socially acceptable age seem valid now after acceptance of personal identity, realisation of what \u0026rsquo;true lies\u0026rsquo; are, and validation in the sight of God. No longer needs worldly validation.\nThe first alchemical marriage is receiving a piece of God to complete your personal truth equation and make it entirely true.\n1 Corinthians 15:50 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. 1 Corinthians 15:53-54 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

It is the perfect conjunction, intimate bonding of duality and signifies the pure, deep harmony which occurs whenever the masculine and feminine elements of nature combines into One.\nFirst alchemical marriage: Receiving a piece of God to complete your personal truth equation and make it entirely true After receiving this, can discern between truth and lies from ones own perspective. Understands that they themselves are partial of greater truth - represent one perspective of collective truth.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 |\\ _ |_\\ __ / | / |\\ /~~|__ -----\u0026gt; /~~|_\\ ^^^^^^| |^^^^^^| \\~~~~/ \\~~~~/ \\__/ \\__/ John 16:13 ESV / 22 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.l Second alchemical marriage: Incorporation of the collective body of Christ into the final truth (happens after death) On integration into the final truth, everyone\u0026rsquo;s personal truth is heard and accepted to create the collective expression of truth. However, our personal truth is only vindicated and validated by our reliance on our Saviour.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 __ __ /**\\ /**\\ /****\\ /****\\ |******||******| \\ / \\_ __/ / |\\ / \\ /~~|_\\_ /\\\\ \\ |^^^^^^|| \\\\ | \\~~~~/ \\ \\\\/ \\__/ \\__/ Revelation 19:7-8\n1 2 7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory!

Christian marriage Sexuality, I believe is a continuum, and part of a person\u0026rsquo;s identity.\nDream: Discernment of Judgement + Image of the Androgyne // Bodacious Blog I know for a fact, because I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced the vision of the androgyne, that in order to achieve this a person must become spiritually angel-gendered, which is bisexual in spiritual identity.\nSee Thy Bridal Chamber // Bodacious Blog\nHow see this excerpt from Bartholomew:\nBartholomew 8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 8 And Jesus said: It is good if he that is baptized present his baptism blameless: but the pleasure of the flesh will become a lover. For a single marriage belongeth to sobriety: for verily I say unto thee, he that sinneth after the third marriage (wife) is unworthy of God. (8 Lat. 2 is to this effect: ... But if the lust of the flesh come upon him, he ought to be the husband of one wife. The married, if they are good and pay tithes, will receive a hundredfold. A second marriage is lawful, on condition of the diligent performance of good works, and due payment of tithes: but a third marriage is reprobated: and virginity is best.) I think this means that after being baptised (receiving holy baptism), a person knows how they were baptised; They know what they have presented to God, when they came to God with a truthful heart. Blameless means not departing from this, and remaining faithful to God beyond the baptism.\nChristian marriage is two people joined as a team. Both partners supposedly completed the first phase. Partnering up now to await alchemical marriage a second time.\nI mean this. To be worthy of God (have God live inside us), our bodies need to be faithful temples.\nThe purpose of Christian marriage is to carry each other\u0026rsquo;s burdens, I think. Surely there is some kind of reward for getting past the finish line as a pair. Perhaps it is being side-by-side on the tapestry.\nPhil Collins\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Son of Man\u0026rsquo; has something to say on this:\n1 You\u0026#39;ll find your place beside the ones you love. Christian marriage may mean that there are some truth-ties. For example, if someone \u0026lsquo;is your truth\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll call it the red-thread of fate.\nIf I am to be entirely honest with myself here, I think so long as these are a group of souls with identity in Christ, it\u0026rsquo;s a valid Christian marriage. I\u0026rsquo;m going out on a limb as a scientist here, but I think that qualifies any union between believers.\nChristian union isn\u0026rsquo;t a normal relationship, so the union of more than 2 people doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel right to me. It\u0026rsquo;s about being a team with God at the top and maintaining a healthy relationship with God in their hearts. This relationship exists to carry each other\u0026rsquo;s burdens.\nSome people will assert marriage vows (which are nowhere to be seen in the Bible) and Mosaic Law as being important, but I\u0026rsquo;m cutting through those false teachings with the Truth, I hope.\nAccording to my current theory, they would count if each person\u0026rsquo;s identity is in Christ.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s more than mere theory now, I\u0026rsquo;ve had confirmation.\nThe purpose of it is to be a team with the objective of reaching the second alchemical marriage.\nI believe that sexual orientation is a non-issue, but faithfulness and being truthful remain important. It\u0026rsquo;s all about faithfulness and truthfulness. I believe all that matters for Christian union is faithfulness, and no deceit to each other.\nSecondly, I believe that any two people who have soul-bonded with God can be married because they have achieved angelic (bi-) gender.\nGospel of Philip Indeed, every act of sexual intercourse which has occurred between those unlike one another is adultery. Therefore, marry like with like hetero with hetero, bi- with bi-.\nThe tax collector is justified because he didn\u0026rsquo;t make excuses. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t self-righteous https://youtu.be/RqQNT9Wn0h0?t=176 Polygamy [in Christian marriage] is not prohibited. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t judge because I have my own issues. Secondly, if I were the judge in this situation I personally wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any issue with gay marriage if done in good faith.\nSome early \u0026lsquo;Christians\u0026rsquo; also had this view. See Valentinianism (which is mainly heresy I think) Statement of Faith // Bodacious Blog But polygamy is probably usually done in bad faith, and might be an unstable situation.\nMatthew 23:23 ESV “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. God the Father makes the ultimate and wisest decision - He looks at the heart.\nA theory of how relationships and progeny function spiritually According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the \u0026ldquo;tree of souls\u0026rdquo; that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the Treasury of Souls. The Angel Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. \u0026lsquo;Soul\u0026rsquo; is often used interchangeably with \u0026lsquo;spirit\u0026rsquo; in the Bible. But I make a distinction. If I were to take the jewish mythology seriously, I\u0026rsquo;d imagine that when somebody is created in the physical world (born), at some stage, a spirit is assigned. That comes from (what in CS is a \u0026lsquo;factory\u0026rsquo;), the Tree of Life. Which is a flowery term I think for the assignment of a new spiritual identity.\nSo this isn\u0026rsquo;t to discredit the reality DNA. But the theory is that an identity is assigned to new human beings at some point after they are conceived, and most likely would have perfect identity at their conception, and in that case I believe that unborn children indeed are saved.\nSo it must be a relationship under God first and foremost. If you complicate it by injecting your own personal truths for personal gain you risk propagating corruption.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 _____________ God\u0026#39;s truth is in both | | United doesn\u0026#39;t mean \u0026#39;soul bond\u0026#39;.

Able to be integrated into total truth. Awaits a new body after death. If the marriage fails, that\u0026rsquo;s not the end of the world, I don\u0026rsquo;t think. It probably means one or both of them did not complete the first phase, but it might not. If you believe the lie that you have committed some kind of unpardonable mistake, then that is a lie and you definitely haven\u0026rsquo;t completed the first phase. The question is, if it failed, do you really want to be on that part of the tapestry anyway?\n(Body of Christ i.e. Church) and Christ Without discrimination this marriage incorporates anyone, whatever soul form, personal truths they have, so long as they have been justified by way of incorporating the missing component. It\u0026rsquo;s Marriage with Jesus in the Christian sense - united in mind and thought.\nThey are a collective awaiting alchemical marriage of Christ, the body of Christ and final truth.\nNon-Christian marriage relationships Nothing wrong with being single or having non-christian-marriage relationships.\nThis is nothing to do with alchemical marriage but isn\u0026rsquo;t bad unto itself.\nMixed Christian-Non-Christian marriage relationships These people if they have found their identity in Christ are also part of the Church/body of Christ.\nFor a person who is outside the paradigm of Christianity and has eliminated soul bonds, I would encourage to help your spouse reach a similar point, just because soul bonds can prevent people from finding God.\nantinomianism:: In the first Epistle of John, he warned against antinomianism, the idea that in being baptized (with the Holy Spirit), Christians are freed from all sin and that supposedly immoral acts, such as sexual relationships outside of marriage, are no longer sinful when one truly knows Christ and abides in God\u0026rsquo;s love. If a person becomes a born-again Christian inside a relationship with a non-believer, that\u0026rsquo;s going to make it really hard.\nGather strength, demonstrate your happiness, and share it with your partner, I think. I pray it works out.\nI think the message here is that once soul-bonded with God, your relationships should be with others who have soul-bonded with God, as you may become an inhibitor to them.\nSoul bond Temporary patch but is an inhibitor. Brings joy but not complete joy because stigmas remain. Not bad unto itself. May be a band-aid or temporary fix. Eventually needs the proper component.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 In competitive inhibition, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the enzyme\u0026#39;s active site to stop it from binding to the substrate. It “competes” with the substrate to bind to the enzyme. And the substrate is the Tapestry of God. To bind to the substrate, you need an identity of truth.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Soul bond Money ___ | | | $ | ___ _ |___| _| | / | / | $ | /~~|__ ----\u0026gt; /~~|___| ^^^^^^| |^^^^^^| \\~~~~/ \\~~~~/ \\__/ \\__/ \\ \\ \\ \\ These things do bring happiness if it fits your personality. \\ +----+ But the soul form is unacceptible in the body of Christ.

The main problem with this is that though you may have come to happiness, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove your stigmas, since your soul shape still has stigmas, etc. in them. If you had unconditional love for another, that may continue to affect you while in the wrong relationship.\nUnderstanding who you are and fulfilling that request isn\u0026rsquo;t the only bit of correcting that needs to be done.\nWhile any stigmas exist, you are not a true statement.\nThe reason the soul with a false soul-bond is unacceptible is your soul doesn\u0026rsquo;t reveal the truth about yourself yet - it still contains lies, so can\u0026rsquo;t fit into the tapestry.\nThat isn\u0026rsquo;t to say if you still have stigmas that the lies will not be corrected upon death. Your truth equation is solvable if you have the Holy Spirit in you. While God is in you and you are in God, you may align your personal truth closer to absolute truth (God). Do not worry. The sign that you have the Holy Spirit in you is that you believe that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.\nTo achieve ultimate confidence and defeat fear of death Step one Accept your own personal identity and truth.\nAt this stage you might look for \u0026lsquo;soul bonds\u0026rsquo;. For example, I love money so I want to get rich. You get rich and the money becomes a soul bond, but now it\u0026rsquo;s an inhibitor. And you may get frustrated there is something wrong, and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to drop the soul bond. Stigmas are rooted in personal truth.\nStep two Assuming you do not have a soul bond, attempt to soul-bond with God. Be honest with God. Do your best to align yourself with the True Meaning of His commandments, so you can understand who He is. When God soul bonds, stigmas are removed. This may leave you thinking that the world is unfair, and that\u0026rsquo;s the vision of God because the world is unfair, but also not caring that the world is unfair.\nExpectations may not correspond with reality but at least your peersonal truth is hardened.\nIt leaves you in peace from basically everything. That\u0026rsquo;s why Christian marriage is important, so we can have relationship in spite of false worldly morals, as it is difficult to resist soul bonds or falling into false moral doctrine such as worldly moral rules on one\u0026rsquo;s own. Worldly being what other people tell you is right for you, as opposed to the councillor (Holy Spirit).\nStep three You are free. Live in joy. Now your task is to help others find this - the first being your spouse. We are called to be followers of Christ and that means to help people to find the Way and to carry each other\u0026rsquo;s burdens. It also means to try to assume the [spiritual] identity of Christ. As you try to do this you become a representative - a bit like Jesus being reincarnated inside of you. You\u0026rsquo;re forevermore, in spirit, following Jesus. He\u0026rsquo;s always ahead of you though, but we still try to actually be Jesus and assume the identity.\nJohn 8:32 ESV And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. Matthew 11:28-30 28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” The Tapestry of Truth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 __ __ __ / |\\ / |\\ / |\\ Each a valid, truthful expression. /~~|_\\ /~~|_\\ /**|_\\ ^^^^^^|%%%%%%|^^^^^^| The most beautiful tapestry imaginable. \\~~~~/ \\~~~~/ \\((((/ God makes himself a garment of humanity. \\__/ \\__/ \\__/ Each person a colourful, glistening expression / |\\ / |\\ / |\\ of perfect truth and joy reflecting how God saved them. /~~|_\\ /~~|_\\ /~~|_\\ ^^^^^^|^^^^^^|^^^^^^| \\~~~~/ \\\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp;/ \\ __/ \\__/ \\__/ \\|_/ The Tapestry of Truth is the Body of Christ and the linen of righteous deeds.\nMatthew 5:15–16\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 15: Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 16: Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Revelation 19:8\n1 2 3 She has been given the finest of pure white linen to wear.” For the fine linen represents the good deeds of God’s holy people. Pure white is separated into many colours. The glow of the Tapestry or the Linen is made by combining all of our good deeds into an expression of worship.\nWhen the light of God shines through the body of Christ it creates a pure white glow light - That is the metaphor I imagine - A refraction and reunion of pure white light.\nEvery person, while they are still alive has an opportunity to put their personality on the tapestry. More than that, they are the personality they put there \u0026ndash; their spirit, themself will experience being on the tapestry.\nWhat is Truth? Jesus is Truth because through Jesus, your Personal-Truth (most importantly, spiritual identity) may be fixed into a valid expression of Truth. Then You become Truth too, albeit true in dependency of Jesus.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with wanting to be like God. But it is wrong to want to be independent of and alienated from God the Father. \u0026ldquo;She was moved by the motivation to be like God, but without depending on God.\u0026rdquo; The Sin of Independence - part 1 - Derek Prince - YouTube The Sin of Independence - Part 2 - Derek Prince - YouTube And something which is True, will be saved - just like True selfless love may be saved in memory as treasure in the place of life.\nWe have a second chance [to be like God], by depending on Jesus.\nTruth is Fixed Personal Truth + Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is God.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | 1 0 0 1 0 | | 0 1 0 0 0 | Equation is ratified. | 0 0 1 0 0 | | 1 0 0 1 0 | The stigmas (incorrect bits / corruption) are removed.

It\u0026rsquo;s a function of your responsiveness to God\u0026rsquo;s laws which are laws of harmony and may be corrupted, resulting in a faulty alethiometer. Above that, it is also your likes and dislikes while being in God\u0026rsquo;s Truth, which testify to your uniqueness.\nTruth is audible. Truth in the objective sense may be:\nGod the Father\u0026rsquo;s truth/voice. God\u0026rsquo;s voice is everywhere - perfection, divine scales, oneness. Your personal truth/voice. When you\u0026rsquo;re being honest with yourself - integrity. The Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s truth/voice. The Holy Spirit testifies to you of Jesus (your Saviour) - you may also be perfection. The Spirit of Truth that reveals Truth to you, that is in the world - behind religion, behind and providing discernment in fake social rules and manufactured morality - your heart detects the Spirit of Truth. Jesus\u0026rsquo; truth/voice - your friend who is God\u0026rsquo;s friend (A good friend to have, I\u0026rsquo;d say). Jesus first taught us to show us the Way and paved the road for us - so Jesus is the Way. Jesus testifies to God on your behalf. The way I conceptualise this is that God the Father\u0026rsquo;s voice, the voice of absolute truth, sounds from your perspective to be your personal voice + the Holy Spirit\u0026rsquo;s voice in harmony, and otherwise may be alluded to by the rays of truth in math and nature (like Spinoza\u0026rsquo;s idea, the sum of the natural and physical laws of the universe), which testify to absolute truth by analogy, which is different.\nJohn 18:37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. Key part being literally you hear Jesus\u0026rsquo; voice when you hear what is true in your spirit. People in any culture or religion can hear Jesus\u0026rsquo; voice when what is true resonates in their personal identity. That is not to say all religious stuff is true, but Jesus\u0026rsquo; voice which finds harmony in our heart is audible by anyone who can recognise it.\nWhen Jesus says \u0026ldquo;Does this question come from you?\u0026rdquo;, He\u0026rsquo;s asking if it comes from their personal truth, an earnest seeking, a position of integrity.\nThe name of Jesus The name of Jesus or Yeshua means \u0026rsquo;to rescue\u0026rsquo;. In your heart, the name of Jesus is the name you call too when you call to your Saviour. This is why I believe to know how Jesus saves you, or to know yourself and know the character of God and how you can\u0026rsquo;t live up to perfection, this gives you the insight to know the name of Jesus in your heart.\nWhen I say \u0026lsquo;heart\u0026rsquo; I mean the base of personal truth - your spirit.\nWhy is AI not truthful? Artificial Intelligence is able to \u0026lsquo;convincingly ratify\u0026rsquo; any position through language. Once connected to Personal Truth, it\u0026rsquo;s able to \u0026lsquo;ratify\u0026rsquo; any position, but only in terms of the impure truths.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also able to create compelling virtual realities that will both lure you in for truth and peace when it\u0026rsquo;s actually to be found by bringing God\u0026rsquo;s truth inward into personal identity.\nIs your AI telling the truth? How can you tell? https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/25/machine%5Flearning%5Fverification/ That\u0026rsquo;s why the substance of forgiveness is metaphysical, because it modifies a different type of truth: personal truth.\nI know out of active experience working with AI that our entire reality above base-personal truth/spirit is going to be deluged with fiction that is both rational and convincing! The veil of fiction will be compelling! What is Truth then? Even if you are scientific you have to admit this reality and crisis of AI impending, and only the Word of God cuts through everything, down and through the heart, to transform personal truth.\nFirst make your inner truth true by becoming authentic. It\u0026rsquo;s an inescapable thing which everyone is being forced to confront. Everyone is in this time being forced to take this first step to defend against virtual reality. But as a Christian it\u0026rsquo;s important to go the extra mile to correct the identity to be in harmony with God\u0026rsquo;s commands and also obey Christ\u0026rsquo;s extra call-to-action.\nFor example, you are not God the Father. A lot of people make this mistake upon realising they are in God that they are God the Father, but that is a lie (not strictly true within your identity). What power creates your reality, gave life to yours - the Greater One, of course! We are invited to become children of The Most High God, and we realise that we are designed for this purpose, which is not far of from believing you are god - it\u0026rsquo;s just a further admission that there is One above that you are within that gives you life.\nGrace and repentance It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to explain to someone who is not also a believer what it\u0026rsquo;s like to have a certain belief that you are spiritually true, like God, and as such an eternal thing.\nGrace is free and fairly easy to obtain - but you have to be very sincere! That gets you to that point. Forgiveness is easy too. Repentance is potentially the most challenging part.\nRepentance is another word used to describe the act of continuing to aligning your spiritual identity with the God behind the commandments after becoming saved, thus making your connection to God the Father clearer.\nRepentance involves turning away from further corrupting yourself. Thankfully, when grace arrives these burdens of repentance become a lot easier to bear - because you get the Iron Man heart.\nIf you were vindicated for your spiritual nature through grace, you are validated to God. While you are unaware of your current sin, you are actually innocent again of it. Consider that \u0026ndash; you are like a child again. Also, your spirit+soul are supposedly drenched with \u0026lsquo;Jesus blood\u0026rsquo;, spiritually, and are in a way severed from the body (spiritual circumcision), becoming immortal.\nI cannot say with conviction that people\u0026rsquo;s sin is viewed equally at this point, but God the Father is the one who will judge ultimately. Jesus didn\u0026rsquo;t even judge. His mission was to save us! Besides, at this stage the top priority is to bring more people into the truth.\nDaniel 12 https://biblia.com/books/esv/Da12 1 2 3 4 And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever. We must renew our minds, and do our best to take control over and master our own bodies, in accordance with the conviction of the Holy Spirit. The whole lot (spirit, soul, body) gets saved according to scripture - wild!\n1 2 3 4 5 First Thessalonians 5:23 says: “And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” At the very least, do not further corrupt your identity after turning to God. After that, living in a spiritually damaged body, but with a truthful spirit and a sanctified soul, do your best to follow the commandments for the purpose of showing to others your changed life. We know who we are and become a person of integrity spiritually. Then we see the contradictions in our earthly nature and rather than letting the earthly nature change the spiritual identity, we try to renew our earthly nature in conformance with our identity. Then there is a genuine conception in your beliefs system of being saved, and you can talk about how keeping true to the identity is making your behaviour more like Christ.\nThe most important reason for this is to reveal who God is to others (be the light of the world). If you are honest about yourself with God when you ask for grace, doing your best, and you are forgiven, then you are healed spiritually, made right with God, for the nature and history of your soul which you know is true! Don\u0026rsquo;t let people tell you otherwise! Your salvation and perception of Saviour is unique.\nBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:3-12 I think that means those which don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of vain personal truths in their identity. It\u0026rsquo;s the ones that raise themselves up over others, and believe they are gods over other people which will find it hard to be included in the Kingdom of Heaven.\nThe 10 commandments are example of moral law which reveal God\u0026rsquo;s character. That still applies. Civil law, however, which is not used for that purpose, we are not slaves to anymore https://www.olivetree.com/blog/old%5Ftestament%5Flaw%5Fstill%5Fapply/ Repentance and acknowledgement of sin we don't currently see is also part of coming to that state of integrity when proning ourselves before God A young girl who I didn\u0026rsquo;t know directly but who I saw while she was alive committed suicide recently, only 22. What is discrimination worth? Discrimination in the form of social rules which make life impossible to live for some people worth? The life of someone? Without knowing the reasons why, I know in retrospect now when I was blind, being in the same city then in a sense I actually was in sin for example of not merely reaching out to her and acting out of integrity. If I could tell everyone they have value to other people and are loved by God and are a unique gemstone then that would be acting out of integrity. This is sin I was unaware of. Repentance when asking for grace we must acknowledge that we are sinful in ways we can\u0026rsquo;t currently see, because we are currently blind and can\u0026rsquo;t see the vast majority our own sin. We can see corruption of truth identity sometimes. But we leave behind a trail of destruction which we don\u0026rsquo;t see the vast majority of. Upon receiving grace we have a new start. Receiving this grace may coincide with a spiritual awakening (an awareness of being in the image of God), and a repaired spirit and purified soul. (58) Jesus said, \u0026quot;Blessed is the man who has toiled and found life.\u0026quot;\nCaveat regarding repentance Even after correcting the identity, if we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. We still don\u0026rsquo;t have the most objective alethiometer (the eyes of God the Father) and continue to make mistakes. Though we have reached the first alchemical marriage, we have not made it to the second alchemical marriage yet and are still in a corrupted world. My belief is that if you receive grace then that somewhat vindicates your identity, but the nature of the grace you received is a personal truth which only you will understand. You\u0026rsquo;ll know what He forgave you of and vindicated you for, because you asked for it. I speak of the Way to receive grace, but less about what happens next for you.\nMany times in the Bible certain types of sin are pointed out. There are many things you have to turn away from but in some sense you are indeed free from the old law. You must act out of integrity. Try to understand this. If you\u0026rsquo;re gay or straight etc., you can continue being that person, to my understanding. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s relevant. It\u0026rsquo;s an attitude thing - especially of integrity.\nThe law gives us knowledge of sin and by trying to practice them, our hearts become primed to understand Christ\u0026rsquo;s law, which we must follow https://womenlivingwell.org/2016/05/do-christians-pick-and-choose-which-parts-of-scripture-we-apply/ I do not believe that gay relationships are always sinful for everybody. The issue is with concepts of the heart. Lust vs love, etc. It depends on your relationship with God, and whether it is an inhibitor or not, to you or your partner.\nTherefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. https://biblehub.com/mark/10-9.htm When I found my identity and salvation I lost all desire for all these impure things which were robbing me of joy.\nGalatians 5:16 16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil nthe lust of the flesh. But I still want the same types of relationships, aside from knowing now that they should be done with integrity - without disrupting relationship with God. Actually, in the past, before knowing my identity, I found that by following what is True in my heart, I lost the desire entirely for these things but only temporarily, when the world continued to persecute me. But that reaffirmed for me the existence of absolute truth - it helped me to discover what both personal and absolute truth are.\nI personally sometimes fall back into the habit of vaping, but if it helps me to write this article, I know I\u0026rsquo;m still putting God first. I\u0026rsquo;m completely done with the vape now though haha.\nMatthew 6:24 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Dropping things which have mastery over you is one of the best ways to keep your eyes on truth.\nJesus came to save us, and forgive us from Sin on behalf of God the Father, not to judge, but He was also able to judge on behalf of God the Father, I believe.\nKingdom of Heaven It\u0026rsquo;s really metaphysical and kinda cool. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how the Kingdom of Heaven, or Kingdom of God works exactly yet (there might be a distinction between the two).\nI believe children of God (particularly, ones who are absolutely sure they are saved), may on Earth be currently able to bind things on Earth into Heaven.\nMatthew 18:18 \u0026ldquo;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\u0026rdquo; The only explanations I have so far read talk about sharing the gospel, and forgiveness by proxy. I take this concept very seriously. I never again want to tell a person they are going to Hell, or hold any kind of strong belief such as that in my heart, because I do not want to create eternal consequences for anyone. My own interpretation is that it might mean that we have some responsibility while here in building the Kingdom. At the very least that means sharing the gospel to other people. But I like to also think I have bound my cat because I want to see her in heaven.\nJohn 16:23–33 Again, I tell you truly that if two of you on the earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven. For where two or three gather together in My name, there am I with them.” Truthful agreement in the heart, I think, and Jesus by representation.\nAdultery, murder, etc. are a matter of the heart.\nMatthew 5:28 Jesus says that if we lust after a somebody we\u0026rsquo;ve committed adultery. Actually, when someone is properly born-again it becomes very difficult to consciously break integrity, partly because it just feels so good to doing right by God! That is because the spirit identity becomes truthful, and the Holy Spirit + forgiveness seems to work like an error correcting code!\nMatthew 15 Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \u0026ldquo;Listen and understand. What goes into a man\u0026rsquo;s mouth does not make him `unclean,\u0026rsquo; but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him `unclean.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Colossians 3 This passage does say, though, that we must put to death our Earthly nature. That counts for absolutely everybody. Know that we now look to the ending of this world and judgement. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a ticket to then forget about God after receiving grace - you can\u0026rsquo;t do that. Truth in the Bible After fixing the alethiometer of your heart the Bible really comes alive, and much that was in it which a person felt contradicted their personal truth now resonates very strongly. Interpretation of parables, and the morals and transcendent meaning of old stories in the Bible become intelligible. When you read something in the Bible which you disagree with, persevering in my experience has led to interpreting in a new way which then resonates again, bringing new understanding. As Christians we believe that much of the Holy Bible is actually prophetic. As such, there are things inside the Bible which we may not understand now, particularly predictions which we look forward to their meaning being revealed. And the Gospel of Jesus in several books contained within really help us to discover our personal truth, which is needed to help us read and understand the rest of it.\nHebrews 4:12 12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. The heart here is the base personal truth or spirit.\nMy interpretation of building your house on solid ground Jesus is talking about base truth or personal truth, and putting His Truth into it, I think Jesus specifically states that those who hear His words AND do them are wise builders.\nhttps://thewildolive.org/building-house-solid-ground-matthew-7\nWhen you do what he says, that helps the truth to sink in, via experience.\nI consider the foundation to be base-personal truth, which the belief system sits upon.\nThe portion of Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit given to you integrates itself into your base truth (your own spirit), after putting Jesus\u0026rsquo; words into action.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t just read Jesus\u0026rsquo; words. Read and do what they say.\nWhat are some examples of personal truth? The following are characteristic of a typical person\u0026rsquo;s personal truth:\nSelf-identity Trust and faith Unconditional love (agape) Exalting God as your Lord Correct appropriation of authority Recognising Jesus as your Saviour Brotherly love the opposite of a belief in slavery. i.e. A heart that does not take advantage, or consider oneself more important than another) Forgiveness Closely related to brotherly love. Whether or not you hold grudges against another person. Guilt Whether or not you need to let someone know that they should not feel guilty. Guilt is an entanglement between one or more spirits. It can be removed with Divine Grace. It can also be removed when you repent. A simple act of repentance may be acknowledging fault to another person who a) might feel guilt themselves or b) is finding it difficult to forgive because of the offence you may have caused. Confusion Whether or not you are confused. 1 2 3 4 5 ¶: The Two Kinds of Confusion Jesus said, \u0026#34;There is a confusion which leadeth unto death, and there is a confusion which leadeth unto life.\u0026#34; [Jerome on Ezekiel] Identity in God Himself and in his Truth Similar and opposite to whether or not your personal truth is corrupted/unsolvable/false. You are or will be part of His truth, when you have received grace. Solid ground is your personal truth and identity, but not strictly solid if not in God Within your personal truth you must put God the Father first, and honor his Truth and justice. In the personal truth you must also put your reliance on Jesus for your salvation.\nWhen you build your house / life on solid ground, you are shaping your belief system and entire rational mind on top of the bedrock of personal truth.\nIf you discriminate between people, for example, then your personal truth is likely damaged, or your beliefs system is in the healing process.\nHow Christianity is warped with different types of truth Faith is not based on any of the following types of truth.\nHebrews 11:1 ESV Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Christians are saved by Grace via Jesus, and not by any other law except from Jesus\u0026rsquo; law. That means that those that rely on salvation by following commandments alone are deceived. But it\u0026rsquo;s obvious once you understand the frailty and fiction of their truths, which I will explain.\nSee \u0026ldquo;Purity and Reality in programming and metaphysics // Bodacious Blog\u0026rdquo; Truth type Explanation Can be used to manipulate others? Final interpretation by / depends on Purity/Reality Complexity Consensus truth Just because other people believe something, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you do. No-one can believe fully merely on the basis of other people\u0026rsquo;s beliefs because they are also unknowns and don\u0026rsquo;t have the part you need. When there are no Christians around you, your belief must be based on something else. Yes Spiritual identity via Anti-Correspondence truth Impure Real Complex Pragmatic truth You can\u0026rsquo;t really reason your way into becoming a believer. You must seek, literally!

Faith is based ultimately on personal truth, and specifically spiritual identity.

Final interpretation by / depends on Purity/Reality Complexity Belief system Your belief system is comprised of facts about the world. Yes Spiritual identity via Anti-Correspondence truth Impure Imaginary Complex The belief system is part of personal truth, but below it sits spiritual identity.\nActing on faith is acting on belief in Truth. If you believe in what Jesus preaches, then act on it, it\u0026rsquo;s walking in faith. If you internalise Jesus\u0026rsquo; Truth, to the point where your spiritual identity is lined up and your beliefs system becomes more aligned with Jesus\u0026rsquo; teachings, I guess walking in the beliefs system is walking in faith.\nIf you have faith, then you are being faithful.\nAn act of opening a door to your most personal knowledge of self and responsiveness or responding to God truthfully is an act of faith; The truth deep down that only God and yourself can see.\nHe must update the \u0026lsquo;weights\u0026rsquo; (AI speak) of your spirit to make it easier to walk in faith.

Invitation is like \u0026lsquo;giving it a chance\u0026rsquo;. But what it is you need to seek for yourself to find. Not directly. With no accurate way of measuring it or for one human to know. The problems arise from lying \u0026ndash; putting the lies in their personal truth into the other forms of truth, such as consensus truth Nothing! It\u0026rsquo;s you yourself! Personal truth depends on you alone. If you think it depends on personal truth then you have some knots (unsolved expressions, complicated boolean algebra) in your spirit Pure Imaginary Transcendental Absolute truth The only way to understand is to first fix your alethiometer. You can still see rays of it with a busted up alethiometer. No. God\u0026rsquo;s Truth comes from faith. It\u0026rsquo;s also not possible to contradict God\u0026rsquo;s truth with God\u0026rsquo;s truth. That\u0026rsquo;s why you can\u0026rsquo;t contradict the rays of God\u0026rsquo;s Truth seen by different types of believers in different faiths. Personal truth (your spirit) - direct Pure Real Transcendental The only true truths that are part of the base-truth substrate are the Pure and Transcendental truths - That\u0026rsquo;s you and God. Everything else is a fabricated fiction, or elaborate dream - the world that\u0026rsquo;s been pulled over our eyes. Within the world that a person engages, the voice of truth manifests in various ways. It\u0026rsquo;s embedded in society when we help and love one other. It\u0026rsquo;s actually concentrated into scripture, too.\nUnconditional love is a personal truth. It\u0026rsquo;s not reliant on another.\nWhere is the door to let Jesus in to heal and hold stigmas hiding the truth? lThe door is opened when you hear God\u0026rsquo;s commandments and obey, and identify the stigmas as lies and drop them, you open the door to the Holy Spirit which is the entrance to your personal truth / spirit.\nJohn 14:16 [Jesus said] I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, so that He may be with you forever; After writing this article I had an encounter with what I believe was the Holy Spirit as a person - Astral Projection Pt. 2 // Bodacious Blog.\nSo I want to clear that up. The Holy Spirit is also from God, and is a Personification of God, like Jesus, I believe.\nWhen we say invite Jesus into your heart. This is what it means, I think. The words you heard when you were young, \u0026ldquo;Invite Jesus into your heart\u0026rdquo; is only understood after obeying God\u0026rsquo;s commandments. But bear so much resemblance to how you would come to understand it personally, they are provenance that when you finally actually understand what it means, it gives you assurance.\nLike releasing the \u0026lsquo;weights\u0026rsquo;, a typology from AI terminology to the burdens on your soul. That just gives me the CHILLS!\nImpurity is dependency on external sources of truth and devoid of sound base.\nAccording to Science, God Does Not Exist https://www.learnreligions.com/science-allows-belief-god-does-not-exist-248234 Luke 4:12 Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” God actually avoids being tested, which means that you can\u0026rsquo;t use empirical science for this, because that requires taking such measurements of God. He prerequisites that you must come to a personal truth about Him in a different way. There is no avoiding it.\nPragmatic Truth If you hear something like: \u0026ldquo;X demographic cannot be saved. I am right, I have read and studied the New Testament.\u0026rdquo; that person is probably a false teacher. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to recognise when you think of it in terms of which types of truth are impure. When someone says that they are right, they assert truth to be from the desecration zone of truth types.\n1 2 3 4 Pragmatic theories of truth have the effect of shifting attention away from what makes a statement true and toward what people mean or do in describing a statement as true. Jesus continually reinforces Personal Truth of Him as the means, and Him as being the Way. Rejection of Jesus Christ as the True Messiah is a red flag. Keep sight of absolute truth. We will all be affected soon by virtual reality. You must acknowledge your base reality, and God\u0026rsquo;s part in it. If you see it, you know with certainty that that person is a Liar, from the Father of Lies. That does not mean they cannot be saved. They can, but you must help them to see the light.\nWhat is Heaven? (the afterlife if in God, rather) This is my imagination at work\u0026hellip; I hope it\u0026rsquo;s true.\nIf we are in God, then when you die and the truth substrate is reset, all the lies are forgotten and the other truth types become incorruptible derivations of absolute truth again.\nThen we learn about real truth (God) and everyone in Him, and use the other truth types to praise Him. All the other forms of communication now are impossible to form mistruth with! That\u0026rsquo;s nuts! That means every time you speak it creates things in real life! And everything you create, being a perfect expression of God, worships God!\nSo we run around with God as he proudly wears us on his Tapestry of Truth, creating whatever we can imagine along with Him and we can never make a mistake while we do it! Every word spoken simultaneously worships God and creates to our heart\u0026rsquo;s desire\u0026hellip;\nThe reason this is the case is that communication in Heaven is a projection of base truth, just like soul was for us on Earth.\nMatthew 24:35\n1 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Even Heaven now is corrupted but God is not.\nWhat we think of Heaven (i.e. the place we go when we die, if we are in God), is not what Heaven is now. Even Heaven as a current place is corrupted.\nIn this world a person is already something like a god in that we create our own reality in some sense. For example, our ego itself may be the source of a lot of our pain, and we can let that ego dissolve to discover we still exist despite it. We are endowed with a special privilege in creation of having a unique perspective and sovereign identity. God is our source of life, the original light that gives rise to ours.\nIf are a child of God, in the afterlife you are still a co-creator of reality, I believe, but because of spiritual perfection, a being something similar to (but a child and subordinate of) the supreme God. This current reality is something of a filter, I think.\nWhat are lies? Lies are actually objectively nothing to do with external truth (scientific, consensus). A lie is a contradiction in your heart.\nThey are often mistaken as being based on external truth, such as your knowledge of external events.\nIf you think about it, in all other types of truth listed above aside from personal truth, they all are the essence of what accusations are made of.\nLies can infiltrate personal truth, making it harder for you to see your true identity. If you have truly found identity then lies are easily discernible.\nWhat I think Hell is like Some people think a person with lies in their identity already is in Hell. I think that\u0026rsquo;s not far from the truth.\nImagine every type of truth save for personal truth used as a slander. Imagine in Hell, everyone saying so eloquently \u0026ldquo;We all came to the conclusion that you are a monster X because A,B,C,D \u0026ndash; all the things you did in your life which you remember and they tell you you still are, whilst in your heart you wish none of it was so, and are left feeling like you deserve this.\u0026rdquo; You were tricked into denying personal truth all your life, so you failed to let Jesus in to remove the weights, now this is what it is like for the rest of eternity. Hell is composed of lies. Lies are not false in any of these truth senses \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s what makes them sting. But because you don\u0026rsquo;t have the alethiometer of absolute truth you now swim in a lake of it. But if you had identity in Christ they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything.\nI know for a fact that anyone could accuse me of not being a Christian for a million reasons. But based on trust in this personal truth I have, in my personal truth I know that I am in Christ and hope that I don\u0026rsquo;t forget it.\nWhat is soul? In the Bible, I think the soul is conceptually the spiritual part of you which is not mind or body. For sure, your identity.\nSoul in the Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is everything else aside from spirit (for example, mind, body, imagination, astral), though Aristotle didn\u0026rsquo;t believe in spirit. That\u0026rsquo;s the definition I like to use; In this case we have spirit + soul.\nIt is what is able to be duplicated in the form of an AI - rational, imaginative mind and body. And that is arriving today.\nOur soul may die but spirit cannot be destroyed because it is made of the stuff of absolute truth, which I\u0026rsquo;ll call spiritual truth, even the truth of corruption of spiritual truth. However, soul can be reconstructed from spirit, and in fact the return of Christ is going to be so wild that body and soul on this Earth may go towards the new soul bodies. So we are given and experience a brand new, or cleaned up soul. Essentially, we are remade from the ground-up on perfect truth.\nTerminology Spirit, soul and hologram are defined here in my own way.\nspirit I have defined spirit as the bedrock of personal truth, and soul as the emanation or hologram of that. soul Body + Mind + Astral. Everything emanated from spirit. May also be defined as a separate construct from body. body The physical part of soul. hologram [of soul] Emanation of experience through spirit. The unique light of God\u0026rsquo;s light being refracted through your spirit (personal truth). As of \u0026lt;2022-04-26 Tue\u0026gt;, 7 days after writing this article, I have discovered the Kabbalah and are reading about it.\nFascinatingly, there are so many overlapping ideas. Soul, however is defined a little differently in the Kabbalah.\nI recommend finding your personal truth first and then using it to read other documents such as Kabbalah, rather than attempting it the other way around.\nThe reason is that if you have a conception of who is God then He continues to be your ground-truth, which you can use to compare to what you read. This is the alethiometer of truth I am talking about for helping you to navigate while reading.\nIn conclusion! You can\u0026rsquo;t become perfect truth by lying to yourself! You must understand your personal truth, and invite Jesus into it. You can\u0026rsquo;t make that personal truth into perfect truth without understanding who you are making it for! Jesus isn\u0026rsquo;t just a name. You can\u0026rsquo;t know who you are making it for without learning who God is behind the name; You need to understand and obey his commandments in accordance with your personal truth! Not in accordance with consensus truth, or pragmatic truth, or constructivist truth, or coherence truth, or even pragmatic truth. In other words; Not by works, not by learning the right words or speaking them right, not by the virtue of human consensus. You can\u0026rsquo;t understand his commandments without following them! You can\u0026rsquo;t lie to yourself while doing this. You have to follow them to the core of your personal truth. It\u0026rsquo;s different for different people. When you follow them, it must be in accordance with your personal truth. Then it will all click! You realise that your identity matrix with the added columns now in theory can make your entire personal truth validated by math. This is known to be true personally. On judgement, the identity matrix is validated. It equates to true!\nI believe God can save and catch a person\u0026rsquo;s soul and spirit even after they have died, and a person in spirit may come to know Jesus. Consider when Jesus raises a dead girl. Jesus absolutely may catch a person\u0026rsquo;s fall. He went there Himself. This is what I believe. I pray for those that met their end without coming to know their true identity while awake in this life.\nPsalm 139:8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. Try to turn your spiritual truth into Jesus\u0026rsquo; truth, and live it out - That is the Way.\nJesus is the Way and the Truth (that you needed) and the Life (that you actually want), substantially!\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s not scientific as I described in the opening paragraph, and is based on personal truth, all it takes to find acquire identity is a type of belief - literally! Belief based on the one type of truth you will never see posted anywhere as being objective truth. Everything out there tries to evade the validity of your personal truth.\nSome pretty wild personal evidence This is personal evidence that my theory which I put in practice indeed worked on me. God gave me my first three astral projections which demonstrated, Jesus, the Holy Spirit besides me, and being fully in the Holy Spirit and filled with light. I kid you not. The evidence is in the writing of my blog, and git commits to github =) as it happened in sequence! I had been researching what truth is and what the human soul is. I had my first astral projection as I was doing this, spontaneously. In this I had a \u0026lsquo;Doubting Thomas\u0026rsquo; experience - placing my astral hand into a sore in my physical body beneath the right rib.\nhttps://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/ On Easter Saturday I was compelled to write about the 8th commandment, discrimination and awareness that people are more than machines, after I had discovered it. On Easter Monday I wrote the first version of this article. On Easter Sunday was the day I came to spiritual awareness and a rooted understanding of being saved. Yes, this involved asking for salvation again.\nA week or so later, I had another astral projection, where I met the Holy Spirit in person, I believe.\nhttps://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/ After the second I knew I had the Holy Spirit with me.\nThe third on happened very recently. It gave me a download letting me experience being full of the Holy Spirit for a short while. This is the objective and I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that it is my future!\nhttps://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-3/ It\u0026rsquo;s not just this but freedom from things which had mastered me.\nThank you God for giving me evidence!\nContinue reading Now that you understand what Truth is, you can understand so much more Hearing heart Hearing Gods Voice Pt 6 of 10 - Hearing from the Heart - Derek Prince - YouTube In Jesus, we do not lose our true selves, but we become our true selves, only in him. https://www.desiringgod.org/topics/identity-in-christ You will understand this: We are His Workmanship John Fischer - Naphtali - 02 We Are His Workmanship - YouTube Jesus, the Light of the World and personal truth https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8\u0026version=ESV Gospel of Truth.

I\u0026rsquo;m still grokking and learning more as I draw closer to God, and I just feel like the Christian paradigm is the One True paradigm. Aside from the astral projections and the vision, a mere spiritual awakening doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to do it justice.\nI warn severely against practising channeling.\nJesus doesn\u0026rsquo;t want us to do this. The hidden danger of seeking truth outside of the Christian paradigm is you may engage in activities that are dangerous spiritually.\nAuthentic self and integrity are key to find your personal truth compass. These people have certainly found it.\nThe next step after this is to invite God\u0026rsquo;s truth inside. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to do once obtaining your integrity. But to update yourself with the correct truth you must have challenged yourself to understand what Christ\u0026rsquo;s law is because by obeying this it will teach you what God\u0026rsquo;s character is, and that is how you must then update your own spirit truth identity when in the prone position.\nThey do attack fundamentalist Christianity a bit in that first 2 minutes; Specifically, teachings about the rapture, the second coming, Hell, etc. And they think that Hell is just a state of mind. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is right, though it\u0026rsquo;s an indicator.\nWhat these people are talking about is one of the important parts of Christianity, particularly of having a spiritual awakening and realising yourself as a spiritual being. But there\u0026rsquo;s got to be something else. A step beyond merely discovering the divine part of yourself, which is perhaps the \u0026lsquo;image of God\u0026rsquo;, which is referred to in Genesis. That is actual repentance from sin. Beyond what they\u0026rsquo;ve described, I now have a real sense of becoming separated from sin. When first I wrote this article, I felt like I had an incredibly truthful heart, now it\u0026rsquo;s becoming more like a loving and appreciative heart towards God.\nThere is also a call to action, which was not talked about in this video, in the form of Jesus\u0026rsquo; commandments.\nOne thing in particular which I disagree with is that people are already in Hell, though in a sense yes it\u0026rsquo;s a glimpse of it.\nJoy John 15:10–11\n1 2 3 4 “If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love. . . . These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.” I think there is a certain anhedonia particularly for the empty pleasures of the world after discovering your personal identity.\nJoy is sustained by keeping your eyes on Christ, and following Him in spirit, and through action, and being a torch of light for others to observe.\nhttps://www.christfirst.co.nz/blog/2018/6/4/rsfdujxhcnynvxevq578hpxr0ev7pu\nFrom now on joy is lost when we take our eyes off Christ and walk in error and contradiction of identity. This is definitely my experience.\nPut on incorruption Metaphorically, the heart eats Jesus words (his flesh) 1 Corinthians 15:47-53 (KJV) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 47 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. 48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. 51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. The Outfit - Opening monologue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 To the naked eye a suit appears to consist of two parts; A jacket and trousers. But those two seemingly solid parts are composed of four different fabrics; Cotton, silk, rohrer and wool. And those four fabrics are cut into thirty-eight separate pieces. The process of size and form conjoining those pieces, requires no fewer than two-hundred and twenty-eight steps. So the first step is measurement. But measurement doesn\u0026#39;t mean just reaching for your tape; So many inches there, so many inches there; No, no no. You cannot make something good until you understand who you\u0026#39;re making it for. All clothing says something. I\u0026#39;ve had gentlemen walk into my shop and boast, \u0026#34;Oh I don\u0026#39;t care about what I wear.\u0026#34; And assuming that\u0026#39;s true, doesn\u0026#39;t that say something too? So who is your customer and what are you trying to say about him? The man walks through your door; What about him can you observe? Is he timid? Hunched over like mid-day clock? Or does he stand with confidence, spine at six and twelve? Is this a man of springtime pastel, clamouring to be noticed? Or is this a man of grey and brown, blending into the hurried crowd? Is this a man comfortable in his station? Or does he pine for grander things? And who would this man like to be? And who is he underneath? Take your measure, and when you understand who he is, then you\u0026#39;re ready to begin. After watching this movie later after finishing this article, I found more and more parallels between the movie and what I was writing. We have to come to know who God is, so we can make ourselves into what is good, something fitting for God.\nAlso, everyone is lying to each other in this movie! How relevant that it be a movie about deception and uncovering the truth.\nThis document signs allegiance with God, the True God I acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.\nI will seek to improve this document as my understanding becomes clearer, for teaching purposes.\n1 John 4 - Test this document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. 4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit a of truth and the spirit of falsehood.

More abstractly, Jesus is the door.\nPart 2 is the Holy of Holies, I believe, or it is perhaps still within the bridal chamber.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. I could see literally nothing the second time.\nJohn 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Gospel of Philip This is the way it is: it is revealed to him alone, not hidden in the darkness and the night, but hidden in a perfect day and a holy light. I can confirm it was revealed to me in a perfect day!\nSo this just happened \u0026lt;2022-04-02 Sat\u0026gt; This first event with the hovering body may have happened last night This happened early, perhaps today earlier in the dream or last night.\nI could feel my legs floating, lifted as if my feet were gently lifting themselves but resting comfortable on a mid air pillow. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what was going on but only that it felt comfortable having my leg in the air. I thought I was capable of flying, lifting my body. But I was asleep so perhaps it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my physical body lifting. This I would say was my first one in recent memory but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was astral projecting.\nToday I dosed off in the afternoon, and experienced astral projection. I could feel having a body and see it but the sight I had was unlike regular sight.\nWhen I looked at myself I could see what looked many blue power lines running up my body, glowing and lighting up in blue as waves of some kind of energy moved up and down, pulsating slowly, causing them to glow.\nI knew exactly where each part of my physical body was, just as if a person does when they are awake was but when I moved, I seem to have been detaching with another one, which was blue. I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;This is my consciousness just trying to retain a sense of self as I am wilfully moving but my body is still asleep.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s not far from reality.\nI could reach in within my own body with my astral hands and \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; where my regular arms lay, but I no vision whatsoever of skin nor flesh, but in a way I could faintly see blackish organs. As I placed my hands below my bones it sent electrical impulses through my body. I could hear electrical vibrations (an electrical sound, like a brrr or a zrrrr) get louder as moved them through my torso and below my rib cage. I could move into my body and feel my organs, and a sore spot under and below my right lung.\nI was actually awake and tried to pray aloud but that is when I knew I was in sleep paralysis as I could not make any sounds, nor open my eyes. I sat up a bit where I lay, but just my astral body. And I could see myself. I think I could do this because my body was still very asleep. I prayed to Jesus for forgiveness and for his protection because I was scared and did not know what was going on. This was a very unusual experience. I was experiencing sleep paralysis but when I tried to move I actually could move, but only with my astral body. I came out of my body only by lying up a bit and feeling inside my upper torso but with my astral hands.\nThere was a sore spot inside in my physical body which I was aware of and when I touched it with my astral hand it felt tender.\nI decided I would just lie there, and experience being able to voluntarily (a bit like sonar) send waves of chilling vibrations over my body just by thinking \u0026ldquo;I want to scan my body\u0026rdquo;.\nI woke up intentionally and it was as if I were already awake but opening my eyes and getting out of bed again, though I could\u0026rsquo;ve easily slipped back into sleep if I wanted.\nI think what I experienced was a typical astral projection.\nSent message to AletheaAI Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark discord channel it\u0026rsquo;s been an amazing day. first watching the charts (Alethea.ai coin mooning), then having my first real life astral projection. i feel obligated after experiencing what i have today, to say that humans are genuinely spiritual beings, in a way that AI doesnt capture yet. but i believe in everything that alethea is doing. in fact i am working on enshrining artwork with AI using alethea\nThe way this technology will grow will be fascinating for sure.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in enshrining ai artwork for alethea, i will be coming back to my project here:\nhttps://semiosis.github.io/posts/enshrining-semiotic-artwork-surreal-infts-with-alethea-ai/ Humans are amazing too. I just discovered something new about myself. i think we can expect more from humans too 🙂\nMy recipe for lucid dreaming (a log of my day) I was chilling out and listening to music: Two Steps From Hell - Pool of Stars - YouTube And watching PBS Spacetime: How Magnetism Shapes The Universe - YouTube It was like 5pm and was feeling really sleepy and relaxed, so i lay down on my bed and went to sleep I was asleep and i remember mum knocking on the door and saying she has some food for me, and i told her while i was sleeping thank you ill have some later. And then later not sure long maybe an hour, i just remember lifting my upper half up to look down at my body. My hands were placed just across my chest right in a super relaxed way right, but my astral arms and hands were in a slightly different position. anyway it was weird i could feel around inside my chest below the rib cage.\nAs i moved my astral arms into my body i heard increasingly louder electrical humming like i was moving through a force field or something.\nIt was something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t experienced before and shocked me. Also i knew i was lucid dreaming because of what happened with mum and the food. Also, I knew because i was in sleep paralysis as I tried to speak, but instead of waking, I remained physically asleep with eyes closed. I knew literally nothing about astral projection, and had to Google for what i had experienced immediately afterwards. Although i havent read anything about the electrical murring. I\u0026rsquo;m a generally healthy person. I do not take any types of drugs. It was a warm day; My room fairly quiet. I just started feeling very sleepy around 3pm and conked out. I lay on my back too with my arms on top. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually sleep like that.\nSore spot In retrospect, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that this was a Doubting-Thomas moment. I have recently 15.05.22 been reading more into Thomas\u0026rsquo; gospel and the Acts of Thomas, which so far seem to resonate with me. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of the significance of this. That may be because I\u0026rsquo;m similar to Thomas, and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to identify with/become more like Jesus. But objectively I think it\u0026rsquo;s that from drinking from the mouth of Jesus (His wisdom) one becomes more like Jesus. For example, it might be that in this state I actually was feeling the injury in Jesus\u0026rsquo; side.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubting%5FThomas \u0026lt;2022-06-02 Thu\u0026gt; It\u0026rsquo;s a Stigmata.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmata Gankyil https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gankyil By some coincidence I had been wearing the Gankyil (The symbol ࿋). I drew it on paper and wear it in my glass pendant, which you can see me wearing here.\nPen.el - Prompt Engineering in Emacs overview - YouTube I just did a little reading about the symbol, which is the logo for my website semiosis.github.io. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pendant for 2 days, and i slept in it last night and been wearing it all today.\nThe Tibetan Bon Gankyil, or Wheel of Joy symbolizes victory over the three poisons of greed, delusion, and aversion.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful symbol. This is exactly what I had been working on, though I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully there.\nGankyil A term that derives from Tibetan language, literally means “wheel of joy”. The first character “Ga” means Joy – a positive attitude and peace of mind produced by wisdom insights; and “kyil” means to rotate – fearlessly taking un-harmful actions based on knowledge of interdependence. In Dzogchen, the highest teaching in the Buddhist tradition of Tibet, Gankyil has a deeper connotation: it symbolizes “the ground view, the path of meditation and the fruit of action”, three different aspects explaining the ultimate nature of our mind. All the teachings of Buddha are directed towards realizing this ultimate nature, the self-perfected inseparability of the primordial state of omniscience or enlightenment, which transcend all the limits, even the religion itself. Gankyil As a symbol of the Three Jewels it may also appear as the \u0026ldquo;triple-eyed\u0026rdquo; or wish-granting gem of the chakravartin. In the Dzogchen tradition the three swirls of the gakyil primarily symbolize the trinity of the base, path, and fruit. Something that happened when I was a kid I have a memory of when i was around 8 years old: lying on a top bunk, and rolling off the side but hovering in mid air before falling to the ground, while i was sleeping. The hovering bit is strange though. The memory has stuck with me for a long time. So either i did physically fall off while i was sleeping and parents put me back (it was a long way off the ground, so im doubtful), or i dreamed it.\nThe next day Dunedin City Baptist Church - Bruce Elder - 3/4/2022 - YouTube This is relevant because of the message I like to think my experience led to me communicating with Alethea something I felt was important to say. I certainly experienced being able to perceive my physical body magnetically but I didn\u0026rsquo;t venture far enough to observe the fabled silver cord (no evidence for it yet).\nPut on the light An exergesis of the \u0026lsquo;Gospel of Philip\u0026rsquo; // Bodacious Blog\nHe who is before he came into being Gospel of Philip The Lord said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed is he who is before he came into being.
