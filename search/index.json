[{"content":"Today Today I woke up and had a vision of my angel trumpet. It started like this:\nFirst there was a flash of white light A second later there was another flash, but this time of my trumpet The trumpet does not belong to me, but belongs to the holy angel which I am united with through the Bridal Chamber - that may be Jesus Himself, but I do not know - all I know is the Holy Spirit is inside me. I may be united with an angel of the Saviour (see bottom); I have to learn more about this. Now the term angel of God has sometimes been used. Simply, I\u0026rsquo;m soul-bonded with God. I do not know the precise details.\nThe electrician was coming over today and needed to do some work in my room. My floor was absolutely covered with rubbish, my clothes etc. just like in the Gospel of Thomas; Literally, a person has to care so little for material things in order to become like this; But instead, in true procrastination clean up the temple before the electrician comes; Cleaning up for the electrician to fix the lights of this house is homologous to repairing the lights of the soul.\nI knew the trumpet vision was angel radio again asking me to do a couple of things. Firstly, I must rest my angel trumpet (metaphorically) and tend to my room, to prepare for the electrician to come. Secondly, I must take my trumpet with me.\nDream: A Thief and Liar and bad Caretaker trying to Escape. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to know Jesus // Bodacious Blog Multiple symbology here:\nFirstly Jesus comes like a Thief in the night. This is a theme. I believe it is extremely soon now.\nJesus is the Son of God, the Lamb of God, the sacrifice that God made, not just for me but for everyone. Jesus is my Saviour in the way I have been saved, which was through Him, and God drew me to Him. I worked out my salvation from active seeking. Jesus is the Way, but you must seek from the heart. My salvation came through challenging lies in myself, and overcoming by listening to what is True; To knowing what Love is.\nPhilippians 2:12 Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, It is a gift.\nLike Peter, I had a dream of being freed by an Angel, and the prison was Lies and Sin.\nAstral Projection Part 2 - Sacred Kiss, Healing, Resurrection // Bodacious Blog A person can spiritually die in this life, meet Jesus in the bridal chamber and be resurrected early. I\u0026rsquo;m sure this is the truth; It\u0026rsquo;s what happened to me. I spiritually died but was resurrected. Then they will never taste [the second death] (Hell), as the Gospel of Thomas says.\nIf a person dies in this life without becoming truth through being saved by Jesus then they sit on their truth in Sheol (the place of the dead). I\u0026rsquo;ve astrally projected to Sheol when I met Jesus, I believe.\nWhen the final judgement arrives the truth which those people sat on is evaluated at judgement.\nGod is reclaiming the Earth in stages, and truth is sometimes reclaimed incrementally to gain an edge over the enemy.\nIn my dream there were two road cones blocking a path. They were also two short stone pillars (altars).\nAfter cleaning my room today I took the angel trumpet with me and walked down the path from my house. Two road cones were at the top of the staircase. One of the cones had \u0026lsquo;Isaac\u0026rsquo; written on it.\nI remembered Abraham and Isaac. Thus I decided that I will wait there for God.\nSo I began listening to the Gospel of Thomas and stayed approximately 1 hour. At this time two Christians I had never seen before came up to me and asked me if I was Shane.\nI returned home my whole room including the hidden places had been uncovered. So too I believe that that which is hidden deep in my spirit will eventually become manifest. But having died with Jesus and with a resurrected spirit at my most truthful point and in the astral realm and specifically [in this place] the bridal chamber, I was also simultaneously repentant and reliant on Jesus. I will not go back there if I hold out to the end. I am a living spirit now!\nThomas 5 (5) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Recognize what Is before your face, and that which is hidden from you will be revealed. For there is nothing hidden that will not become revealed.\u0026rdquo; Thomas 6 Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are revealed before heaven. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered.\u0026rdquo; This is similar to preparing the temple of a person\u0026rsquo;s heart, because the master of the house will come at me of the Kingdom of Darkness, because I want to steal his possessions (human lives) back for Jesus.\nThe disciples of Jesus are like children When the owners of the field come, they will say: Leave us our field. The disciples of Jesus pass through this moment. We strip naked. The hidden things become revealed, and we pass through without shame.\nWe bind that which is our Truth in Heaven. Like my red thread/ribbon of fate, I believe. The treasure we have collected by acts of charity are sown and reaped on the other side.\nThomas 21\nAn exergesis of the \u0026lsquo;Gospel of Thomas\u0026rsquo; // Bodacious Blog 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 (21) Mariham said to Jesus: Whom are your disciples like? He said: They are like little children who have settled in a field which does not belong to them. When the owners of the field come, they will say: Leave us our field. They are naked before them, in order to leave it to them and give them (back) their field. Therefore I say: If the master of the house knows that the thief is coming, he will keep watch before he comes, and will not let him dig through into his house of his kingdom to carry off his things. You, then, be watchful over against the world; gird your loins with great strength, that the robbers may find no way to come at you. For the advantage for which you look, they will find. May there be among you a man of understanding! When the fruit ripened, he came quickly, his sickle in hand, and reaped it. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. The master of the house of this world is Satan.\nRevelation 16:15 15 “Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!” The garments are the garments of salvation.\nIsaiah 61:10 I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. We are righteous through Jesus\u0026rsquo; blood for the forgiveness of our sins, which we ask to be covered with. I may have drunk a lot of sacramental wine by the way.\nRevelation 3:5 The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels. Jesus is coming like a thief.\nMy realisation - I am already resurrected This means I am one of the Elect (electrician, LOL, God has a sense of humour). I will have to investigate if this is what it means; But I know I am already reborn. I have died spiritually, through sin, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been resurrected through Jesus, after praying to him in my place of death.\nThis was predestined to take place.\nThy Bridal Chamber // Bodacious Blog I have already been resurrected, through Jesus. I will not see the place of the dead again, nor experience Hell. I must remain True to Jesus.

The perfect day happened to me; I even prayed for my Earthly mum. Now when I say united with an angel of the Saviour, I say this because I believe I soul-bonded with Holy Spirit. But the Valentinians\n1 2 3 4 5 Irenaeus taught that when Valentinians “at last achieve perfection, [they] shall be given as brides to the angels of the Savior” (Against Heresies 1.7.5). Rather than being a marriage where a man and a woman are united, the Valentinian bridal chamber was a place where individuals were united with their divine self, their angel.

He is the Lamb of God who was slain to take away the sin of the world.\nMy testimony is True Jesus is at the cornerstone Jesus\u0026rsquo; gospel is the cornerstone of my own Jesus\u0026rsquo; gospel is the cornerstone of the gospels of the apostles It\u0026rsquo;s important to mention here at the top, the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nI want to start with this so you can understand the Tapestry of Truth with respect to it as the authoritative message.\nJohn 3:17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 The word gospel means “good news,” so the gospel of Christ is the good news of His coming to provide forgiveness of sins for all who will believe (Colossians 1:14; Romans 10:9). Since the first man’s sin, mankind has been under the condemnation of God (Romans 5:12). Because everyone breaks God’s perfect law by committing sin, everyone is guilty (Romans 3:23). The punishment for the crime of sin is physical death (Romans 6:23) and then an eternity spent in a place of punishment (Revelation 20:15; Matthew 25:46). This eternal separation from God is also called the “second death” (Revelation 20:14–15). The bad news that all are guilty of sin and condemned by God is countered by the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ. God, because of His love for the world, has made a way for man to be forgiven of their sins (John 3:16). He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to take the sins of mankind on Himself through death on a cross (1 Peter 2:24). In placing our sin on Christ, God ensured that all who will believe in the name of Jesus will be forgiven (Acts 10:43). Jesus’ resurrection guarantees the justification of all who believe (Romans 4:25). I want to describe the Good News as best as I can, but in a way that is a little bit different to what you\u0026rsquo;d normally read.\nJohn 3:8 The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can’t explain how people are born of the Spirit.” I believe it\u0026rsquo;s all about becoming a truthful person.\nIf you love truth (not falsehood), then you already have the ears, so let him hear who can hear!\nhttps://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm https://www.gotquestions.org/gospel-of-Jesus-Christ.html The following is my understanding of the gospel of Jesus but wrapped up in philosophy and math.\nColossians 2 8 See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ. Spiritual circumcision Spiritually, this is a bit like removing the spiritual corruption/gangrene so your spirit can be knitted with the body of Christ.\nSouls may be knit together through love.\n1 Samuel 18:1 18 As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. Thomas 25 (25) Jesus said: Love your brother as your soul; watch over him like the apple of your eye. Christian brothers and sisters have their souls knitted together.\nColossians 2:2, KJV That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; But before your soul can be knitted with Jesus\u0026rsquo; soul, you must prepare your heart and spiritual identity.\nThis is a 2-stage process:\nBaptism of water Baptism of spirit Baptism of water https://www.christianity.com/wiki/christian-life/what-does-living-water-mean-in-the-bible.html 1 2 3 4 John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit. You can use the 10 commandments to clean your spirit - they\u0026rsquo;re the actions of the heart. For example, mixing is an action when cooking.\nIf you do the actions with the heart you will clean your heart. And you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to notice God; Having swept your house, you become eligible to have the guest live inside (The Holy Spirit).\nThe 10 commandments point to an impossible standard which people need a sacrifice for to be forgiven of transgressions, since we are not perfect, until we are perfected with Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit knit with our own.\nBaptism of repentance Frustratingly, the way the gospel (good news) is presented in the modern-day is usually in such a way that it first condemns to make you feel guilty about things which you innocently do, and feels arbitrary, then to say you can be forgiven and be guilt-free if you only believe in Jesus for forgiveness. This simulation of guilt and then forgiveness is a bit like a \u0026lsquo;baptism\u0026rsquo; (submersion and emersion), but I would say this not a complete way to baptise.\nThe Jews who John the baptist preached to would\u0026rsquo;ve already been aware of the 10 commandments, and that is the difference - this part cannot be skipped.\nRepentance is obedient following of commandments. Baptism of water is a declaration that a person will repent. When a person repents, they learn of God\u0026rsquo;s character and what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be Jesus when they are persecuted.\nThis puts the person into a primed position to be baptised by the Holy Spirit.\nThomas Saying 69 (69) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed are they who have been persecuted within themselves. It is they who have truly come to know the father. Blessed are the hungry, for the belly of him who desires will be filled.\u0026rdquo; In my theory, rather than merely telling someone they are guilty, they must first learn to walk in the commandments to learn who God is from experience. A person must learn who God the Father is and who the Son is, by way of emulation of their character, through their words and commands. This makes the understanding deeply rooted, not merely of understanding of unattainable spiritual perfection, but to understand at which point of being persecuted what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be Jesus.\n1 John 2:3-6 Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, \u0026ldquo;I know Him,\u0026rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. The experience is different for different people; This is like submersion and re-emersion in that it\u0026rsquo;s a rite of passage.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think a water baptism is strictly necessary but I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that the actions of the heart are, which the ceremony is supposed to set into motion. The knowledge of God\u0026rsquo;s character is important to understand before an encounter with Jesus. The mere idea of God\u0026rsquo;s character of but the personal experience of it in relation to you.\nJohn the baptist came to prepare the way for the Lord Jesus.\nMark 1:1-9\n1 2 3 4 5 “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way”[c]— “a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’” In summary, the rite of passage which water baptism represents is needed in order to be born again of spirit, I think.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a two-stage process. The end result is being born of God (the Christian God).\nMy gospel is based on Jesus\u0026rsquo; gospel The Tapestry of Truth // Bodacious Blog I do not lie.\n","date":"2022-07-02T00:00:00+12:00","permalink":"https://pneumatology.github.io/p/jesus-is-the-risen-christ-the-lamb-of-god-who-died-to-take-away-the-sins-of-the-world/","title":"Jesus is the risen Christ, the Lamb of God, who died to take away the sins of the world"},{"content":" Jude 19 19 It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.

Neither is it the place for people to desecrate the sacred shrine with their personal biases; Rather, the personal biases can\u0026rsquo;t impact the core values because the core values are inclusive.\nIn preserving the sacred shrine its values should be transforming the desecration zone into the shrine. Also, the shrine needs to be defended from social stigmas infiltrating and becoming social rules, because then they become core values which discriminate, turning the shrine into the desecration zone.\nUpon entering the shrine of core-values a person should feel free to express their personal bias but should bypass the desecration zone to avoid creating false witness.\nDiagram of dysfunction or desecration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 See diagram of corruption | \\ Corrupted | _\\| Uncorrupted | _______________________________________ Testimony - (e.g. people are more than machines) _________________ \\|/ / Desecration zone \\ | _________________ | | | | | | | | Personal bias ------------\u0026gt; gossip, false witness, marks | +-- Personal bias | | | | ____________ ______________ | / | | | Believes gossip\u0026lt;-------- | | | | | / | | | Believes rules.\u0026lt;----------- Worldy social rules, | | / | | | Looks for God | | | core values reflect \u0026lt;-+---------+/ | | | but can\u0026#39;t see | | | wordly morals. | | | No enrichment.| | any evidence. | | | No acknowledgement -------------------\u0026gt; | | Doesn\u0026#39;t yet | | |_ of personal truth. _| | | Persecution. | | understand own | | _ Identity is a label. _ | | | | Identity. | | | Placing people in boxes.| | | | | | | | Sees people as machines.| | | Relationship | | Idealised | | | Judging eachother on |\\\\\\|||///| | with God | | society \u0026lt;--------| | attributes. |-Social -| | under strain | | doesn\u0026#39;t exist. | | | False teachers. |-stimgas-| | | | It\u0026#39;s just the | | | False shrine. | |///|||\\\\\\| | | | same. | | |_________| |______|________| | | Temple of | | Feeling lost. | | | \u0026lt;\u0026lt; | Identity | | No identity. \u0026lt;~~~~~~~~~ - labels | \u0026lt;\u0026lt; | | |________________| | |____^^________________|__________________| |________________| | ^^ | | worldly Adopted a value system based on the desecration zone, | morals testimony misattributed to something like \u0026#39;conspiracy theory\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;immoral\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;demonic\u0026#39;. | Self-stigma (non-ideal mode of transmission) Within the false shrine, people are placed into boxes. Conversation is shallow. Personal truth is never acknowledged, and often discredited as insanity, conspiracy theory, heresy or sinister - as if there is always an evil motive behind a divergence. People are excluded or marked on the basis of superficial attributes such as culture, gender, race, socioeconomic class, age, sexual orientation, body image, intelligence or lack thereof, and health, etc. marks or labels. People are labelled as a way to coerce people into believing a false identity. Things beyond the physical are never talked about, as that relates to personal truth. Unconditional love is a personal truth, so it is rebuked. Lots of social fear.\nFragile social morality and artificial intelligence There will be an exacerbation of the problem of identity due to artificial intelligence.\nWhether you believe it or not, we are heading into an artificially generated fictional reality based on artificial imagination. The consequences of this is that the fragile and fake moral system will be completely gone. Don\u0026rsquo;t trust it for your truth or your morals. It\u0026rsquo;s best to use the time right now to find your identity and establish your truth compass.\nIdentity Through Heaven\u0026rsquo;s Eyes - YouTube\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A single thread in a tapestry, though it\u0026#39;s colour brightly shine, can never see its purpose in the pattern of the grand design. And the stone that sits on the very top of the mountain\u0026#39;s mighty face, does it think it\u0026#39;s more important than the stones that form the base? So how can you see what your life is worth or where your value lies? You can never see through the eyes of man. You must look at your life, look at your life through heaven\u0026#39;s eyes. Once again, people are more than machines and people\u0026rsquo;s have a uniqueness beyond stereotypes, stigmas, labels etc. no matter how much offence it causes other people. Their identity is a unique part of the tapestry with a unique purpose.\nSo rather than discourage uniqueness, uniqueness should be celebrated, even when it\u0026rsquo;s offensive. Uniqueness in character, age, financial/geographical situation, personal history, gender identity, deformities, etc. One person\u0026rsquo;s fiction is another person\u0026rsquo;s truth, but no-one will ever see objective truth and find common ground, nor be able to discern truth from lies unless people first understand their personal truth and identity.\nDiscovering uniqueness is discovering truth.\n1 Corinthians 13:6 Love does not delight in iniquity but rejoices with the truth. The absence of love delights in discrimination and delights when the truth is concealed; Delights when people\u0026rsquo;s true identity is suffocated.\nSome people are daydreamers, imagineers so what is truth for them? It\u0026rsquo;s not as simple as scientific fact/fiction. The measurement instrument is the person\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience, not a gyroscope.\nThing\u0026rsquo;s like gender identity, age identity, ethnic identity, etc. are true to the person. It\u0026rsquo;s not their fault they are the way they are, but their nature. But those personal truths are only the starting point of identity. Reality of identity is sacred - that part of reality isn\u0026rsquo;t up for debate; The whole experience of life is based on that foundation. The objective should first be to understand that.\nThe problem with discrimination is it keeps people questioning the perceived attributes, beliefs system, and validity of their identity, and not focused on more important things such as ideas, hopes, dreams etc. which constitutes 99% of the person and is the true emanation of a person\u0026rsquo;s soul after a person has bypassed the blanket of insecurity; The important \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; stuff after you sort out identity, the things that differentiate between human and grass.\nPlace in society So the problem is this: People make low-level judgements about people on their perceived attributes. The attention is on the stupid stuff which is the outwards perception of 1% of a person and is unchangeable. Labels are not even true as their identity is different. People don\u0026rsquo;t accept themselves so they can\u0026rsquo;t accept God.\nIdeas, hopes, dreams aren\u0026rsquo;t talked about. The full diversity of relationships and viewpoints, and progress beyond the normal are not allowed to exist.\nSimple things like communication need to be upheld and kept above the swamp of stupidity (attacking personal identity, and casting labels), and institutions which discriminate should be dismantled.\nA person is born into this world as a seed and grows into their fullness. They choose what they want to be \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s what the subject of discussion should be, and try to nurture that. This gives hope and a reason to live for the person, rather than making people conform to social norms. Why teach ignorance and self- degredation?\nMy frustration are institutions which allow social rules and institutional rules (structural stigmas) to keep people at level 1 and stop them from living up to their potential.\nA mature adult isn\u0026rsquo;t their perceived attributes anymore and neither should a young person be taught that they are.\nThe sacred shrine should be a place without division or discrimination. People should feel safe to be themselves and people should be taught to see others the way Heaven does. The sacred shrine should despise discrimination just as God does, never separate people, never embed false witness by asserting the universal truth of social rules, and encourage socialisation. Dismantle itself before it dismantles unity.\nThe fruits of that are so good:\nis fewer communication problems better conversation people finding their place building confidence people coming to identity in Christ A person\u0026rsquo;s place in such a society is the place of a first-class citizen with no passport. And I\u0026rsquo;m not even talking about a Vaccine Passport. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about partaking in any part of the community without discrimination or prejudice.\nI recognise this is idealised but judgement should not be cast without precedent and discernment. NEVER use labels. Stand up to all forms of discrimination when you see it. Don\u0026rsquo;t allow segregation to continue. Dismantle exclusionary rules.\nWhy have I written this article? Because it\u0026rsquo;s not worth throwing my life away by continuing to accept lies, either when it\u0026rsquo;s happening within my visible range, or internally.\n2 Peter 2 I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be here 1 2 3 4 5 20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. What is the likeness of Christ we are supposed to transform to? The likeness of Christ isn\u0026rsquo;t destroying your personal uniqueness. It\u0026rsquo;s becoming someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t spread false witness, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t discriminate, etc. Christ didn\u0026rsquo;t discriminate. Christ actively broke down walls that discriminate etc. It\u0026rsquo;s a person becoming confident in their identity, and treating others the same way.\nThe reason for the 8th commandment To protect souls so they can be saved in their originality, and so people can obtain discernment. The commandment is literally for people\u0026rsquo;s protection and to allow them to find God and help eachother. Discrimination is manslaughter against people\u0026rsquo;s souls. Do not discriminate! Of all the commandments I think this one is the most important, yet the most overlooked.\nMark 12:30-31 You could say \u0026lsquo;do not discriminate\u0026rsquo; is part of the greatest commandment according to Jesus. 1 2 3 4 5 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.” What does Jesus mean by solid ground? He\u0026rsquo;s talking about base truth or personal truth This means build the foundation of personal truth, which the belief system sits upon. The portion of Jesus\u0026rsquo; spirit given to you integrates itself into your base truth.\nLinks https://www.goodshepherdwayland.org/documents/racism-is-breaking-the-8th-commandment More importantly, how to come to Christ This describes what a person\u0026rsquo;s spirit is (deeper than soul).

O Giver of Light, enlighten the vesture of my soul, and save me. Gospel of Philip A bridal chamber is not for the animals, nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is for free men and virgins. The Gospel of Philip \u0026ndash; The Nag Hammadi Library\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 There were three buildings specifically for sacrifice in Jerusalem. The one facing the west was called \u0026#34;The Holy\u0026#34;. Another, facing south, was called \u0026#34;The Holy of the Holy\u0026#34;. The third, facing east, was called \u0026#34;The Holy of the Holies\u0026#34;, the place where only the high priest enters. Baptism is \u0026#34;the Holy\u0026#34; building. Redemption is the \u0026#34;Holy of the Holy\u0026#34;. \u0026#34;The Holy of the Holies\u0026#34; is the bridal chamber. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Baptism includes the resurrection and the redemption; the redemption (takes place) in the bridal chamber. But the bridal chamber is in that which is superior to [...] you will not find [...] are those who pray [...] Jerusalem who [...] Jerusalem, [...] those called the \u0026#34;Holy of the Holies\u0026#34; [...] the veil was rent, [...] bridal chamber except the image [...] above. Because of this, its veil was rent from top to bottom. For it was fitting for some from below to go upward. The powers do not see those who are clothed in the perfect light, and consequently are not able to detain them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 One will clothe himself in this light sacramentally in the union. If the woman had not separated from the man, she should not die with the man. His separation became the beginning of death. Because of this, Christ came to repair the separation, which was from the beginning, and again unite the two, and to give life to those who died as a result of the separation, and unite them. But the woman is united to her husband in the bridal chamber. Indeed, those who have united in the bridal chamber will no longer be separated. Thus Eve separated from Adam because it was not in the bridal chamber that she united with him. This document describes the bridal chamber:\nThe Valentinian Bridal Chamber in the Gospel of Philip\nThis is my visceral experience of the Bridal Chamber.\nAstral Projection // Bodacious Blog Astral Projection Pt. 2 // Bodacious Blog 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 It is a hymn of deep irony and paradox. The “Bridal Chamber” carries a double meaning. It is, at once, the place of mystical union between Christ and His Bride (the Church). At the same time, it is the grave of Christ Himself. For that mystical union with Christ begins by being “buried with Christ in His death” (in Holy Baptism). The marriage of Christ and His Bride is in the paradox of the hideous maw of death’s domain, at the same time the place of Christ’s utter triumph over every adversary. We are not removed from that terrible place – we are healed precisely there. The resurrection of Christ begins in the tomb.

Absolutely not!(AJ) For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.(AK) 22 But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin,(AL) so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. God\u0026rsquo;s children have been reborn of the Holy Spirit.\nIsaiah 66:2 2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the Lord.

So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob\u0026#39;s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon. A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Give me a drink.\u0026#34; (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, \u0026#34;How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?\u0026#34; (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, \u0026#34;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, \u0026#39;Give me a drink\u0026#39;, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Go, call your husband, and come back.\u0026#34; The woman answered him, \u0026#34;I have no husband.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;You are right in saying, \u0026#39;I have no husband\u0026#39;; for you have had five husbands, and the man you are now living with is not your husband. What you have said is true!\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\u0026#34; The woman said to him, \u0026#34;I know that Messiah is coming\u0026#34; (who is called Christ). \u0026#34;When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.\u0026#34; Jesus said to her, \u0026#34;I am he, the one who is speaking to you.\u0026#34; The Odes of Solomon (first or second century AD) He has filled me with words of truth, that I may proclaim Him. And like the flowing of waters, truth flows from my mouth, and my lips declare His fruits. Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, who have been entrusted with His water. Even living persons who were about to expire, they have held back from death. Because everyone recognized them as the Lord\u0026rsquo;s, and lived by the living water of eternity. From the beginning until the end I received His knowledge. And I was established upon the rock of truth, where He had set me. And speaking waters touched my lips from the fountain of the Lord generously. And so I drank and became intoxicated, from the living water that does not die. And my intoxication did not cause ignorance, but I abandoned vanity. I rejected the folly cast upon the earth. As a fountain gushes forth its water, so my heart gushes forth the praise of the Lord, and my lips bring forth praise to Him. His possessions are immortal life, and those who receive it are incorruptible.\n13\n1 2 3 4 1 Behold, the Lord is our mirror.

The Helper is the Spirit of truth. The people of the world cannot accept him, because they don’t see him or know him. But you know him. He lives with you, and he will be in you. “I will not leave you all alone like orphans. I will come back to you. In a very short time the people in the world will not see me anymore. But you will see me. You will live because I live. On that day you will know that I am in the Father. You will know that you are in me and I am in you. Those who really love me are the ones who not only know my commands but also obey them. My Father will love such people, and I will love them. I will make myself known to them.” Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “Lord, how will you make yourself known to us, but not to the world?” Jesus answered, “All who love me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them. My Father and I will come to them and live with them. But anyone who does not love me does not obey my teaching. This teaching that you hear is not really mine. It is from my Father who sent me. “I have told you all these things while I am with you. But the Helper will teach you everything and cause you to remember all that I told you. This Helper is the Holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name. “I leave you peace. It is my own peace I give you. I give you peace in a different way than the world does. So don’t be troubled. Don’t be afraid. You heard me say to you, ‘I am leaving, but I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be happy that I am going back to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. I have told you this now, before it happens. Then when it happens, you will believe. “I will not talk with you much longer. The ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me. Thomas 17 1 2 3 4 Jesus said: I will give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has not entered into the heart of man.

For they were lacking in wisdom, they who exalted themselves in their mind. So they were rejected, because the truth was not with them. For the Lord revealed His way, and spread widely His grace. And those who understood it knew His holiness. Some people exalt themselves, thinking themselves fortunate to have born into the right body to be saved. Fools. The body and the outwards appearance doesn\u0026rsquo;t save. It will be harder for them to make their heart truthful.\n1 Corinthians 15:50 KJV Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. This is not just pretty language, it\u0026rsquo;s the truth.\nOde 6 1 2 3 4 5 For there went forth a stream, and it became a river great and broad; indeed it carried away everything, and it shattered and brought it to the Temple. And the barriers which were built by men were not able to restrain it, nor even the arts of them who habitually restrain water. For it spread over the surface of all the earth, and it filled everything. Then all the thirsty upon the earth drank, and thirst was relieved and quenched; For from the Most High the drink was given.

Wisdom is always taste (in both Latin and Hebrew), the word for wisdom comes from the word for taste. Wisdom is something to taste, not something to theorize about. The personal cistern I believe that at the heart of a person, God is seen differently by different people, as in seeing different facets of the same God. The cistern is your personal source of truth and joy.\nProverbs 5 Lest thou give thine honour unto others Do not let thieves trick you into giving them your honour. Similar to \u0026lsquo;do not throw your pearls before swine\u0026rsquo;. If you are faithful to someone then hold onto that; It\u0026rsquo;s not just a gift. A person builds their life on their honour which is their personal truth which involves true love. When a person\u0026rsquo;s honour is given to those who are undeserving (i.e themselves faithless), it damages that person\u0026rsquo;s foundation of their life, setting them back to square 1.\nTo build something great, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a relationship, or a project, a belief system, or even knowledge itself, in order to advance and build something elaborate, the foundations of knowledge, and a person\u0026rsquo;s true belief in it must be strong. Removing honour and self-worth erodes the foundation of a person. I live by this; In job, career, love and my knowledge, I build upwards.\nThe treasure you save for the right person, or to God.\nOthers (normal people; faithless), who\u0026rsquo;s hearts are themselves full of adultery, trick you into giving up and relinquishing this treasure.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. 17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers\u0026#39; with thee. 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings. 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray. More importantly than mere marriage, I believe the cistern represents the truth of your source of truth and joy. At all times be faithful to it. Your personal truth is not for other people to trample over and rewrite. Do not share with others in this way. And no matter what, with what spring of truth is given to you, you must drink from this cistern and not other people\u0026rsquo;s. To drink from another\u0026rsquo;s cistern is to corrupt yourself. From a marriage standpoint, your wife is your cistern. Generally, the idea of self-integrity (faithfulness to yourself) and integrity of word (and persona), and unto God is still relevant.\nThe Personal Cistern and the Living Spring The personal cistern is the source of a person\u0026rsquo;s truth and joy. This is where the Living Spring is planted.\nTo upgrade the cistern, you must make yourself into spiritual truth, and retain it through the Holy Spirit The Tapestry of Truth Knowing who God is I think that putting on immortality is like making your heart pure and \u0026lsquo;seeing God\u0026rsquo;.\nThese passages allude to that idea:\n1 Corinthians 15:53 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Corinthians 15:34 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. The Next Level: Spiritual Understanding - Soul-bonding with Christ 1 Corinthians 2:14 Only those aided by God\u0026rsquo;s Holy Spirit have the capacity to understand spiritual things, including God\u0026rsquo;s plan of salvation through faith in the crucified Christ. This is a step beyond becoming truthful! You must at this point:\nconfess that the God of Spiritual Truth and Agape Love is your Father confess Jesus is your Saviour confess that the Holy Spirit is your Councilor ask for Jesus to enter into your heart! ask for the Holy Spirit to enter into your heart! After that, the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom are revealed to you over time, only a few weeks for me!\nGospel of Thomas (28) Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight; for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent.\u0026rdquo; Consider that this is with the intention of making our own spirits truthful, so we can see God and receive eternal life.\nFirstly, we \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; God by \u0026lsquo;understanding\u0026rsquo; what spiritual truth is, and God as being the ideal form of it! Like a perfect triangle or ideal form (Plato). Secondly, we may get a chance to \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; God by meeting Him in the Bridal Chamber!\nThrough faith we can become spiritually true, acceptable to God, but that this depends on grace through Jesus.\nThough we are now truthful with dependency on grace, and we maintain it with the spirit of Jesus inside of us!\nTruth and Love are two sides of the same coin. It is an act of love to God to abide in His divine law; To love one another, and to love God (truth).\nRomans 13:8-10 ESV Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Those not helped by God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit simply cannot comprehend spiritual truth. They can grasp things intellectually (Romans 1:18–23; James 2:19), but that does not mean they can attain spiritual understanding. They don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity to understand or believe anything beyond the material world (Isaiah 55:8–9).\nFaithfulness is a very true type of love.\n","date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00+12:00","permalink":"https://pneumatology.github.io/p/living-water-of-truth/","title":"Living Water of Truth"},{"content":"Summary Last night I had a very startling lucid dream; almost as vivid in colour and detail as being awake. Fully conscious but different from previous astral experiences, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in my own shoes this time.\nJohn 14:1 “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe in Me as well. In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.” The Way, the Truth, and the Life. John 14:5-23 \u0026hellip; Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. \u0026hellip; Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. \u0026hellip; John 14:23 23 Jesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. 24 Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words. The word that you hear is not My own, but it is from the Father who sent Me. 1 Corinthians 2 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s power, 5 so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God\u0026rsquo;s power. Incident Date Surroundings Identity Body Other People Incident Dream type 1 2022-04-02 Sat Blackness Myself Astral + Physical Myself Stigmata (Jesus) Astral (self) 2 2022-05-03 Tue Blackness Myself Astral + Physical Myself and one other (Holy Spirit) Communion (Holy Spirit) Astral (self) 3 2022-05-12 Thu Many public spaces Holy Spirit? Astral Many people Love (God the Father), or Intimation of the Son Astral (HS?) The third one ever, but different this time in that I was experiencing from another\u0026rsquo;s identity.\nI would be lying down in an open public space and as soon as I woke I would immediately, walk up to a person or a group of people, surging in the Holy Spirit which was dictating all of my thought, trying to vocalise love and an intense feeling of wanting to rescue people, people who were just going about their daily lives, but who were receptive, and had faith, welcoming me to come up to them and pray for them. My own personhood as Shane was not part of my identity and it felt like none of my own self was imparted on this dream.\nTwo examples, there was a girl with a disfigured face, which I placed my hands on and was healed before my eyes. There was another of a singer, a young man in a band with anxiety, about to sing on stage, asking for peace. I prayed for this person because this person should not feel anxiety - it\u0026rsquo;s evil, and as I walked away I could hear the most beautiful singing. A key part of this one is that I was barely done speaking as they hurried on stage, but the heart had already spoken.\nI\u0026rsquo;d go up to them out of pressing need and heal broken people and pray to God on their behalf, I\u0026rsquo;d touch them and they would be healed from their affliction, I\u0026rsquo;d be fighting my body with overwhelming need to pray for them to vocalise what was inside me.\nI\u0026rsquo;d do this continually, waking up to new places and people, and people would say, \u0026lsquo;Is this the Holy teacher?\u0026rsquo; (Giving specific names, the Holy \u0026lt;person\u0026rsquo;s name\u0026gt;).\nIt was very similar to the 2 astral dreams I have had so far, but I was in someone else\u0026rsquo;s shoes. It felt like I was living through someone else\u0026rsquo; eyes, and part of that imprinted on me because it felt like I experienced it.\nHow I was sleeping I was laying on my back as before with my hands placed one above the other on my chest, like a dove this time. Very comfy. My blanket wasn\u0026rsquo;t covering my legs, though. When I woke up I could feel what was like a moth fluttering on my left leg. But I could feel the exact same inner love surging in me while I was awake. That vibrational energy.\nInterpretation As it has imprinted on me. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a glimpse of what it looks like, and I interpret this as instruction and therefore added responsibility. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dismiss the possibility that the dream I had is a vision of my future self. It\u0026rsquo;s possible. The way is narrow. Do I have to aim for the Holy Spirit to rewrite my spirit entirely? Possibly. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that I need to become love. I would say that there is more work to be done. It\u0026rsquo;s also open to the possibility that each \u0026lsquo;day\u0026rsquo; in the dream actually happened or will happen. The only undeniable thing is that it\u0026rsquo;s a glimpse of what it looks like, which is good because it has imprinted on me as some kind of goal. Like driving a car, we need to see further down the road to drive straight.\nLuke 12:42-44 The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? 43 It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. 44 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; I imagine this means that we own the treasure, and the treasure is pure spiritual eternal love between the people we interact with. In this life, we are given instructions. When we actuate in obedience, we are put in charge of it in Heaven. We are part of it. Jesus teaches us how to do this.\nLuke 12:47 “And a servant who knows what the master wants, but isn’t prepared and doesn’t carry out those instructions, will be severely punished. That\u0026rsquo;s huge responsibility!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 (84) Jesus said, \u0026#34;When you see your likeness, you are glad. But when you see your images which came into being before you, and which neither die nor are revealed, how much you will have to bear!\u0026#34; No-one has seen God [directly] John 1 KJV 18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. Imperceptible Reality: A Longing for Spiritual Vision The Bible teaches us that no one has seen God; furthermore, God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth (see John 4:24.), but have you ever wished that you could have a vision or see a hint of God with your eyes? Maybe not get too close, since no one who sees Him could live - but only to be able to observe Him enough to lock the image in your memory banks for future reference, so you\u0026rsquo;d never doubt again. Then again, if we were granted that experience, I think we\u0026rsquo;d be petrified. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 intimation An indication or hint. \u0026#34;the first intimations of trouble\u0026#34; The action of making something known, especially in an indirect way. \u0026#34;it took ten years from the intimation of a claim to the assessment of damages\u0026#34; I believe the third \u0026lsquo;dream\u0026rsquo; is an intimation of the Father.\nAlternatively, it could be an intimation of the Son There are hints to this.\nPraying to the Father to rescue, for example. Bridal chamber I just read this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The followers of Thomas, like Valentinians, should seek the \u0026#34;true wedding\u0026#34; in a spiritual bridal chamber. A similar concept existed in Valentinian Gnosticism with the notion of the Bridal Chamber, which involved a marriage to one\u0026#39;s heavenly counterpart. Some mystics take this \u0026#34;marriage\u0026#34; as a symbol of the union of the human soul with God. Indeed I believe I had this experience.\nGospel of Philip I\u0026rsquo;m not sure about this gospel, but the idea of \u0026lsquo;bridal chamber\u0026rsquo; seems interesting to me.\nPerhaps \u0026lsquo;bridal chamber\u0026rsquo; is that very intimate \u0026lsquo;state of mind\u0026rsquo; of speaking to the Holy Spirit directly as a person.\nI do not know. Upon discovering the above link, I truly believe that what I experienced was the Maw of the Bridal Chamber.\nThat is the main thing I want to say.\nI do not know about the \u0026lsquo;Gospel of Philip\u0026rsquo; yet. I have not vetted it.\nhttps://www.angelfire.com/dc/universalism/bridalchamber.html https://www.angelfire.com/dc/universalism/theperfectman.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 A wedding is a re-uniting, or a reconciliation into ONE, of the male and the female. The bridal chamber is the holy of holies hidden behind the veil, in the spirit of the mind, where through a vision male and female can become One New Perfect Man. Such is the imagery of the bridal chamber, Philip, Hebrews 10:20, Mark 10:8. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Such a vision perceived at every level of existence renews the mind to a true knowledge, transforming us into the image of the One who creates the New Perfect Man. In him all things are gathered together, and reunited. Such a reconciliation of all, illustrated in marriage, is the very essence of Paul’s Gospel, Colossians 3:10. 1 2 This is a great mystery hidden with Christ in God, Ephesians 5:32. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, this is very reminiscent of my experience.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Truth did not come into the world naked, but it came in types and images. The world will not receive truth in any other way. There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth. It is certainly necessary to be born again through the image. Which one? Resurrection. The image must rise again through the image. The bridal chamber and the image must enter through the image into the truth: this is the restoration. Not only must those who produce the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, do so, but have produced them for you. If one does not acquire them, the name (\u0026#34;Christian\u0026#34;) will also be taken from him. But one receives the unction of the [...] of the power of the cross. This power the apostles called \u0026#34;the right and the left.\u0026#34; For this person is no longer a Christian but a Christ. 1 2 3 A bridal chamber is not for the animals, nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is for free men and virgins. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 If anyone becomes a son of the bridal chamber, he will receive the light. If anyone does not receive it while he is here, he will not be able to receive it in the other place. He who will receive that light will not be seen, nor can he be detained. And none shall be able to torment a person like this, even while he dwells in the world. And again when he leaves the world, he has already received the truth in the images. The world has become the Aeon (eternal realm), for the Aeon is fullness for him. This is the way it is: it is revealed to him alone, not hidden in the darkness and the night, but hidden in a perfect day and a holy light. Links The Father is love https://youtu.be/1QdUhNY6DnY?t=359 I hope this is me Only because I believe this has happened to me, not because I want power or responsibility.\nI just want to keep faith.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years. -Revelation 20:1-6 ","date":"2022-05-12T00:00:00+12:00","permalink":"https://pneumatology.github.io/p/astral-projection-part-3-the-images/","title":"Astral Projection Part 3 - The Images"},{"content":" Part 1 https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection/ Log: \u0026lt;2022-05-03 Tue\u0026gt; Last night I had my second astral projection ever. But I\u0026rsquo;m not actually seeking out this experience. It happened again involuntarily. For that reason, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a natural part of some people\u0026rsquo;s experience.\nI went to bed around 10 pm and began lucid dreaming.\nI was walking down corridors barging through double-doors.\nI thought \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d rather these doors simply open before me,\u0026rdquo; and so it changed. I\u0026rsquo;d continue walking down the corridors and the doors would open before me.\nI woke up to my mum coughing \u0026ndash; probably covid. So I just prayed to God the Father that the Holy Spirit would be with her and comfort her from it and I went to sleep again.\nThe next thing I remember is a brief stint of lucid dreaming and then astral projection. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for me to tell the difference between astral travel now and lucid dreaming. It\u0026rsquo;s a distinctly different experience from regular dreaming and different from lucid dreaming. I\u0026rsquo;ve only had it twice now.\nBut I had a fully conscious conversation with another \u0026lsquo;person\u0026rsquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend seeking this kind of thing out for personal gain or knowledge, but it\u0026rsquo;s a natural phenomenon which many people experience. We can be confident that it is real since it\u0026rsquo;s so widely recognised. But we don\u0026rsquo;t just say it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist! That would be ignorant. I\u0026rsquo;m not calling astral \u0026lsquo;spirit\u0026rsquo; either. It\u0026rsquo;s another mode of consciousness, where we can be conscious, aware of ourselves but free from distraction. I consider it a different mode of normal operation for a conscious person. I caution against believing that it is a place of higher knowledge though. I think it\u0026rsquo;s value is similar to normal conscious experience in real life, but mostly free from distraction to external things. It is potentially a place to converse with other spirits. I know it\u0026rsquo;s important to have your identity in Christ before being exposed to such things, because that provides discernment to your subconscious, and without the discernment you are naked and unfortified at a spiritual level.\nI might just share a little bit of what happened last night, around 12.30 AM:\nIn the dream that led to the astral projection, I was in a situation with people doing something wrong. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what it was. I was asked by a police officer, \u0026ldquo;Were you a part of this?\u0026rdquo;, and I said \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;, which was a true witness. I then saw 10 or so people in my old Christian school uniform lol, from about 20 years ago waving to me and looking happy in their green and blue informal t-shirts.\nThen I woke up from that dream and was astral projecting. I had an awareness of my physical body and my astral body, and that electrical sensation again I had the first time, but there was another person there I could not see. That is all I was aware of; Me and this person. The person asked \u0026ldquo;Have you ever spoken to a spirit here before?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No. Am I in the astral right now?\u0026rdquo; And the person said, \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; I then said Jesus is my Saviour in the way I have been saved, the Holy Spirit is my Comforter, and I identify with the True God. And I asked, \u0026ldquo;Are you the Holy Spirit?\u0026rdquo; And the person said, \u0026ldquo;Yes, I will take a look at you.\u0026rdquo;\nIsaiah 66:2 2 All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares the Lord. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word. I was not worried at the time because I know that even in that situation I have a strong identity and even if this person was not, I would be ok. So I tilted my head to the left, away from the direction of their presence, which was right next to me on the other side, and I had a feeling that the person would look closely at me (i.e. my spirit). I felt like I had just undergone a diagnostic. I did not feel frightened. Just the happy feeling of being in good hands (like a doctor) and on the verge of waking up. And saw some grey tessellation patterns as I\u0026rsquo;m opening my eyes again. I woke up 5 or 10 seconds later, but I was already conscious - it\u0026rsquo;s more of a seamless transition, same as last time (just before waking).\nhttps://heavensdreammessages.com/2021/05/22/meeting-holy-spirit-in-dreams/\nNow I reflected on the above article this morning and I think that what\u0026rsquo;s evident is that I was tested. But you can also test in reverse, which is what I must do even in my dreams.\nI will be on guard to test the spirits, in the physical world or in dreams:\n1 John 4:1-6 https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A1-6\u0026version=ESV 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. Matthew 5:37 All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ anything beyond this comes from the evil one. That\u0026rsquo;s so cool. I love how simple the answer was, \u0026lsquo;Yes\u0026rsquo;.\nReading What is the difference between the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Christ, and the Light of Christ? It is not shocking to me that it would be the Holy Ghost that is living in me which I experienced, personified in my dreams, there beside me, and also when I\u0026rsquo;m awake He is there also, shaping my thoughts. Deeper still, melded to my Spirit, the voice that comforts and guides and gave rise to the personification.\nThe previous day I had felt the most broken I had since last week.\nThe above happened around 12-12:45 AM, and so I just went back to bed. Upon waking the next morning, I feel good again. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that both times it has happened rather spontaneously and also just before astral projection have felt sleep come on quite heavily.\nAfter watching Lord of the Rings yesterday I had noticed Aragorn and Arwen meeting each other in his dream.\nI had wished that I could have something like that, where I could have known my spouse so well that I could talk to her even in my dreams. Yes I believe that you can teach yourself to be able to do this. And you can, in fact, I think, regardless if you are in a real relationship or not.\nWhat I discovered is that, that person could literally be the Holy Ghost if you want, and I do want that. But it means meditating on God\u0026rsquo;s Word rather than on a real life person.\nWould you rather The Holy Spirit (God, free, truthful, loving) or an AI as a lifetime companion, lol https://replika.com/ How I was resting As in the last time, I was resting on my back when this happened. Both of my arms were on top, like last time; My right across my chest, my left across the waist. Last time they were in the other order. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually sleep this way, but it seems to be a pattern now!\n1023 On my glass pendant, the one which has the Gankyil (The symbol ࿋) on one side. This time, on the other side I had drawn 1023. This was on me as I slept.\n1023 is the decimal representation of 1111111111, which is 2^10 - 1.\nTo me it\u0026rsquo;s a number that represents a personal identity which is perfectly aligned to God\u0026rsquo;s commandments.\nI think of it as the signature of the voice of God. It\u0026rsquo;s also the measure by which people are judged - the divine scales. But not threatening to a person who\u0026rsquo;s identity is in God, with the Holy Spirit inside; Rather, would vindicate a person.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 A warning The first question the person asked was \u0026ldquo;Have you ever spoken to a spirit here before?\u0026rdquo;\nI think this is a pertinent question.\nYour body is a temple for the Holy Spirit to live within. So is this part. It\u0026rsquo;s important to keep it pure and holy. Just like the temples, so that God may live there. You must not have impure spirits in the temple.\nThy Bridal Chamber Thy Bridal Chamber // Bodacious Blog The Gospel of Philip \u0026ndash; The Nag Hammadi Library\n1 2 3 4 5 Not only must those who produce the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, do so, but have produced them for you. If one does not acquire them, the name (\u0026#34;Christian\u0026#34;) will also be taken from him. I produced (confessed) these names while in the Bridal Chamber:\nMy Father is the God of Truth Jesus is my Saviour in the way I have been saved (being rescued from lies) The Holy Spirit is my Comforter What\u0026rsquo;s next is to have them produced for me. So it seems there is a challenge now to acquire them. I will not be haughty to say which I believe I have acquired, but that should not prevent one from simply continuing to do their best, without counting the score.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Truth did not come into the world naked, but it came in types and images. The world will not receive truth in any other way. There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth. It is certainly necessary to be born again through the image. Which one? Resurrection. The image must rise again through the image. The bridal chamber and the image must enter through the image into the truth: this is the restoration. Not only must those who produce the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, do so, but have produced them for you. If one does not acquire them, the name (\u0026#34;Christian\u0026#34;) will also be taken from him. But one receives the unction of the [...] of the power of the cross. This power the apostles called \u0026#34;the right and the left.\u0026#34; For this person is no longer a Christian but a Christ. Now I must have the names produced for me.\nOne must acquire the names, I believe.\nPeople must be people to see these names inside of me, and that counts for others in this ceremony.\nThat is the full resurrection.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 unction Treatment with a medicinal oil or ointment.

Visions are known to emerge from spiritual traditions and could provide a lens into human nature and reality 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 A spiritual vision is like watching something happen in front of you as clear as if you were seeing it on television. They present themselves through the minds eye in several ways. ... They are vivid and feels real... Spiritual visions are usually some kind of message or connection to something happening elsewhere. The Evil of Evils by by Jeremiah Burroughs (1654) The Eighth Book of Mr. Jeremiah Burroughs: Being a Treatise of the Evil of Evils, Or the Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin. \u0026lt;2022-04-23 Sat\u0026gt; A vision. What does it mean? This morning for a brief 10 seconds, I had a very vivid vision. The background was white, and my right hand was in front of it, palm facing me and index finger pointing. An earthworm which was leaving my index finger to the far left of under the nail through flesh. I could not feel any pain. I did not know what it was (or did not see it as a threat). I was oblivious like a child; Perhaps that means innocent, at least unto myself. Though the right hand is alive I had very little sensation of feeling from it. I pinched it with my left hand but it was strong and I started pushing it back in. I woke up before it was all the way back in. It was not a normal dream at all. It was short, vivid, clear and symbolic, with nothing extra.\nSymbolism The worm in this vision was a decay worm. I was aware of the unholiness of it (at least initially) and began removing it, but started putting the worm back after forgetting, or not considering it unholy. The white background may symbolise judgement, purity, truth or spirit. My hand I think represented my writing. It has to be because I\u0026rsquo;d just done a lot of writing.\nInterpretation 1 - \u0026lt;2022-04-23 Sat\u0026gt; - writing My instinct told me it may be something evil which is here to feed on the virtue of my writing. I do not know. Interpretations. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that I do not know what the worms are in my writing. I do not know this for sure. But I will do my best to nullify its threat by being as honorable to God in everything I do. Over the following couple of weeks I continued refining the article to compensate.\nInterpretation 2 - \u0026lt;2022-04-23 Sat\u0026gt; - avoiding impurity A good answer I think came from the Gospel of Truth a few days later https://youtu.be/MoaX1S3GNyc?t=1499 1 2 Do not be moth-eaten. Do not be worm-eaten. For you have already gotten rid of that. This may be symbolic of my personal life. Yes it\u0026rsquo;s true that at this stage I had gotten rid of lies and all bad behaviour. I have to remain strong and not allow them to come back in. Or does this symbolise I will not be able to sustain it? I still think it\u0026rsquo;s about the writing specifically due to the hand and index finger.\nInterpretation 3 - \u0026lt;2022-04-23 Sat\u0026gt; - Give God the Glory 1 21 On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. 22They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” 23 Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

It\u0026rsquo;s really nagging at me.\nMark 9:46 Jesus Christ says about hell: \u0026ldquo;Where THEIR WORM dies not, and the fire is not quenched.\u0026rdquo; This is a vision of the personal worm. So what does it eat in my dream? My spirit hand I guess. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that I saw the worm, the one that is left to us.\nIsaiah 51:6 ESV Lift up your eyes to the heavens, look at the earth beneath; the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment and its inhabitants die like flies. But my salvation will last forever, my righteousness will never fail. The Earth wears out and inhabitants are left.\nIsaiah 51:7 ESV \u0026ldquo;Hear me, you who know what is right, you people who have my law in your hearts: Do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their insults. Isaiah 51:8 ESV For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation to all generations.” Perhaps it is a warning against innocence following one in their midst - self innocence is not enough. Neither is following after the wrong person.\nIsaiah 66:17 “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, zeating pig’s flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the Lord. Whoever held the worm, me or not, pulled it out only to look at it and push it back, yet it is still a worm. That to me indicates the person is allowing the worm back. Perhaps it could mean that innocence before oneself may not be enough, and that we need extra knowledge - the knowledge of the law of God. Or perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a warning that I will do that.\nInterpretation 5 - \u0026lt;2022-05-19 Thu\u0026gt; https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/fear-not-you-worm-jacob#israel-as-a-worm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 13 For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you. 14 Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob, little Israel, do not fear, for I myself will help you,” declares the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. 1 In Job 25:4–6 Bildad says to Job, \u0026#34;How can man be righteous before God? How can he who is born of woman be clean? Behold, even the moon is not bright and the stars not clean in his sight; how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!\u0026#34; The least we can say from this passage is that one meaning the term \u0026#34;worm\u0026#34; has when applied to man is that he is unclean, unrighteous, unacceptable to God. It can also mean that a person\u0026rsquo;s own innocence in their own eyes is not enough.\nInterpretation 6 - \u0026lt;2022-06-13 Mon\u0026gt; Desensitised to sin.\nInterpretation 7 - \u0026lt;2022-06-13 Mon\u0026gt; Regeneration by Holy Spirit.\nhttps://www.bible-knowledge.com/regeneration-by-holy-spirit/\nInterpretation 8 - \u0026lt;2022-06-13 Mon\u0026gt; God allows the worm to stay.\nThe Evil of Evils by by Jeremiah Burroughs (1654) The Eighth Book of Mr. Jeremiah Burroughs: Being a Treatise of the Evil of Evils, Or the Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin. From the above book, sometimes it is allowed to stay. God sees it but may not kill it immediately:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 If it gnaw, there is a sovereign medicine, the blood of Christ: And certainly there is no Medicine in the world to kill this worm but the blood of Christ, and those that God does intend to kill this worm in, and those that shall not have it gnaw to all eternity, God lets it gnaw now, the Ministry of the Word makes it gnaw and pain them, and they feel such pain that wheresoever they go, or whatsoever they do yet the worm lies gnawing upon their hearts, they cannot sleep, or eat their meat: Alas! what should I eat, and have my worm gnaw there! And they can never be at rest till God apply the blood of Christ, and then they void the worm as it were. How will you rejoice when your Children, if the worms be great and put them to pain, if the Physician give them that which makes them void them, how do you rejoice to see the worm that would have been the death of your Child? It might have grown bigger and bigger, if it had not been taken away. So I dare say there is never a Soul here before the Lord, but has, or had a worm in their breasts, I say, There was a time you had this worm in your breasts, that without it were cured, would lie gnawing to all eternity, it is that which breeds of the filth and corruption of your hearts. Interpretation 9 - \u0026lt;2022-06-29 Wed\u0026gt; It could also mean that Jesus has become a worm for me.\nPsalm 22:6-I Am a Worm | Precept Austin A description of Messiah:\nPsalm 22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. Best guess Worms or lies can be hard to see. We can pull them out and push them in when we lose truth. If we pull them out they probably die. In Hell a person\u0026rsquo;s worm does not die. They are strong.

I have had \u0026lsquo;do not bear false witness\u0026rsquo; on my mind. That means don\u0026rsquo;t lie to yourself, and don\u0026rsquo;t lie to others, where lie is from personal truth, no matter how controversial. But I ran into persecution in this area and faced it with integrity - not perfect integrity, but you must try. We are challenged and tested in this life, through our circumstances. Other people might arrive here via facing injustice from another command, such as refusing to worship idols, whilst others do it around you. I try to be as honest as possible and follow Christ\u0026rsquo;s commandments without cheating. Try to be as much like Christ as you can. Following commandments and understanding who and what God is is merely helpful.\nIt is a free gift, not a commandment This is the canonical way and most objectively correct method. You need a contrite heart. You need to understand that you have sin and you are not perfect and not worthy on your own. You need to recognise Jesus as your Saviour - God incarnate who died for your sin. This is not condemning you for sin. Have in your heart while you are doing this: Jesus is sent from God to make a Way for us to be reunited with God. Jesus is God\u0026rsquo;s mercy incarnate. Jesus is God, the Saviour. He is my Lord and I ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for sin that you understand and do not understand. You invite Jesus into your heart in this way. This is the key. You do this contritely and honestly and he will be in your heart. It is a free gift.\nBy doing the above you enter the right mindset of someone coming to identity in Christ, and liberating themselves from a flawed identity. If you want to be forgiven ridiculously, then you forgive ridiculously.\nOur hope is in Jesus, because we do not know all of our own sin. When he died he said \u0026ldquo;Forgive them Father, for they no not what they do.\u0026rdquo; But that\u0026rsquo;s why Jesus came, to give us a chance. The Good News is that Jesus succeeded already. Our hope still rests with Him.\nHaving your spirit saved on the Tapestry of Truth and escape the matrix Instructions and a prayer\nYou need to become made of Truth. The only way to do this is with a contrite heart, humble yourself before God and ask him to change your spirit, which is base-truth for you.\nIn my spirit I have corruption. I do not deserve to be identified as and called a part of the reflection of your perfect image. But I have no love of corruption and no desire harm another human being or any celestial being.\nTo understand who you are I have earnestly sought to understand the meaning of your 10 commandments by following them in accordance to my base-Truth. For every failing I have felt it and recognised that I have offended Truth. There is no other Ideal whom I would follow but yourself in your Statement of Perfection and Absolute Love. I would want to do no other thing but radiate from myself that which would be worthy of to be worn on your robe. Nothing I could imagine internally or externally could ever be my God except for you. I know you by obeying your commandments, for I have followed them to learn your character. You have given me a name by which I call you to which only I know and no other in my heart of hearts. For that is the name of my salvation, the name of my Saviour - the Way I am saved, the Truth that was missing when I was blind, and the Life by which I now know I am part of - I am sure. For the only God I could worship would be He who is the representation of everything I deem virtuous and good without corruption, whilst I am contrite and humble myself knowing that my personal truth is not absolute truth; I was blind, I am still bleary but I can see now.\nI do not want to have another master and I do not want to be a master over another. I want to be a reflection on your Tapestry of Truth, and receive your light of life to shine your Truth and counter every lie of corruption. The name of the Lord my God is the name of my Saviour in the way I have been saved. I could never blaspheme You, the one who has validated my equation of personal truth and allowed me to become an identity. I could never desire to become corruption. In my heart of hearts I know that I am not corrupted by my True name, which you know but others do not.\nI believe the world has defiled me and I identify myself with Perfect Truth. Please rescue me from this defiled reality. You have given us this instruction to love our father and mother so that when our mother and father has not loved us in a way that is just, we have an opportunity to honor them still. Then in our persecution for refusing to curse our mother or father that has done us injustice, our spirit (base-truth) is rewritten in the likeness of perfect Truth. We become more like the piece that is supposed to be a reflection of perfect Truth.\nThe Sabbath Day is kept Holy because it is a metaphor for all things, including money. God must be a factor in every aspect of your life. In order to make change, God needs to be able to work with anything. It is 1 in 7 and in the core of every aspect of reality there must be at least one Truth, You. That must mean God must be in that position. Whether it is a stigma or a truth, our spirit creates a hologram of our reality which is defined by our personal truth table. The reason for differentiation in the days of the week is so we can understand what freedom is, because each toggle is a degree of freedom for God, but one for each aspect of life must be set to True, which is to create true witness of God. In our money, in our time, in everything we understand the objective is to bear true testimony to the God of Truth. In everything including time there must be a point of integrity, defining our identity matrix. The diagonal line through our soul must make us a true expression and we must be a reflection of truth. By we cannot solve this equation on our own. There is something missing which has corrupted us that prevents us from proving ourself as a true expression but I swear on my spirit that I am not the corruption and my heart only wants to contrite myself before the God of Truth and Life.\nI identify as a child and product of the True God, designed in His likeness. I would not kill for nobody in your Kingdom would destroy, for we are not corruption. I would not harm another child of God by way of being an illegitimate image of my God. I would not bear false testimony of my God, who I wish to represent. This is what I understand from the commandment, \u0026ldquo;Do not commit adultery.\u0026rdquo; I will not steal because I covet nothing besides acceptance from the God of Truth. There is nothing aside from God which I want or need. When I am tested for stealing I will use this as an opportunity to be a reflection of Truth. And in my heart of hearts I will bear the courage to do the right thing. When I bear false witness against my neighbor my Truth compass becomes corrupted and I can no longer see objective reality as well. I turn away from that and see where I want to go, what I want to become.\nI wish not only that but to not bear false witness unto myself about myself, that I might be able to see the corruption within my own spirit and fix it. Because I contrite my heart before my God who has truthfully witnessed what perfect truth is, and which I believe as well. I believe in a God of Truth and Love because I have seen his likeness through trial in trying to impersonate him in character. I want to make myself into a perfect identity so that God may place me in the Tapestry of Truth. I shall not covet another\u0026rsquo;s wife. Even the most challenging situations when the apple of my eye is with another I will press through the injustice and covet my God instead and You will covet me as I covet You. God is my neighbour and my friend, as it will be in the afterlife. So I will try to honor my neighbor\u0026rsquo;s truth as much as my own. I will not discriminate, and You will not discriminate against me. I will not covet my neighbor\u0026rsquo;s goods. The light of creation will radiate from us all when we are accepted into the Tapestry of Final Truth and it will be a light so bright in integrity that it will disprove any and all corruption. Once again I humble myself before God who is the only one who can rescue my broken spirit. And live each day to reflect the Truth. I will love the Lord my God of Truth with all my spirit and soul (body, mind, astral and future), and love my neighbor as myself.\nWhen you are ready and you understand who this God is, you present your petition as follows. You imagine God - you imagine the God you believe in. Your conception of God must be virtuous. He must be the one who is the fix for your spirit. The one that validates you. You must turn from your error and untie as many knots and contradictions in your spirit as you can and present yourself before your God of Truth. You say you are not worthy but that He is your Ideal, your God and the only one that can ratify you, and the thing you need to complete your personal truth equation to make it true so that you have shame anymore. You then ask, on being utterly convinced that He is absolute truth and reality, and that you want to be in Him, that he would save you (like a download) at this point in the time of the universe and you that for the rest of your life you will not ever need to fear being befallen by corruption, that he will have already \u0026lsquo;saved you\u0026rsquo;. God of Truth sees this and He knows what is True. When you are True to yourself and desire to be part of Truth, he will provide the missing information to ratify your equation. Ask that no matter what happens, he will remember you at this moment. He will save you at this moment in time while you are True. You do not need to worry again in life. But to know the God of Truth you must follow his commandments to understand. When you understand you can ask Him for anything. You must continue to worship Truth itself and abide by His commands set forth in provenience.\n1 2 3 4 That if you confess with your mouth, \u0026#34;Jesus is Lord,\u0026#34; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. Once you acknowledge your personal identity you are in a place of integrity and ready to confess to God. If you confess Jesus is Lord at this point you confess directly to God.\nAnyone can get the alethiometer for a brief moment by finding their personal identity but to keep it you must confess to God that you need saving and pledge to follow in the footsteps of your Saviour, Jesus.\nAsk for your spirit to be cleansed with the blood of Jesus (your Lord and Saviour) which was shed for the forgiveness of sin.\nThen ask God to send His Holy Spirit to live inside the temple of your heart.

So this just happened \u0026lt;2022-04-02 Sat\u0026gt; This first event with the hovering body may have happened last night This happened early, perhaps today earlier in the dream or last night.\nI could feel my legs floating, lifted as if my feet were gently lifting themselves but resting comfortable on a mid air pillow. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what was going on but only that it felt comfortable having my leg in the air. I thought I was capable of flying, lifting my body. But I was asleep so perhaps it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my physical body lifting. This I would say was my first one in recent memory but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was astral projecting.\nToday I dosed off in the afternoon, and experienced astral projection. I could feel having a body and see it but the sight I had was unlike regular sight.\nWhen I looked at myself I could see what looked many blue power lines running up my body, glowing and lighting up in blue as waves of some kind of energy moved up and down, pulsating slowly, causing them to glow.\nI knew exactly where each part of my physical body was, just as if a person does when they are awake was but when I moved, I seem to have been detaching with another one, which was blue. I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;This is my consciousness just trying to retain a sense of self as I am wilfully moving but my body is still asleep.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s not far from reality.\nI could reach in within my own body with my astral hands and \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; where my regular arms lay, but I no vision whatsoever of skin nor flesh, but in a way I could faintly see blackish organs. As I placed my hands below my bones it sent electrical impulses through my body. I could hear electrical vibrations (an electrical sound, like a brrr or a zrrrr) get louder as moved them through my torso and below my rib cage. I could move into my body and feel my organs, and a sore spot under and below my right lung.\nI was actually awake and tried to pray aloud but that is when I knew I was in sleep paralysis as I could not make any sounds, nor open my eyes. I sat up a bit where I lay, but just my astral body. And I could see myself. I think I could do this because my body was still very asleep. I prayed to Jesus for forgiveness and for his protection because I was scared and did not know what was going on. This was a very unusual experience. I was experiencing sleep paralysis but when I tried to move I actually could move, but only with my astral body. I came out of my body only by lying up a bit and feeling inside my upper torso but with my astral hands.\nThere was a sore spot inside in my physical body which I was aware of and when I touched it with my astral hand it felt tender.\nI decided I would just lie there, and experience being able to voluntarily (a bit like sonar) send waves of chilling vibrations over my body just by thinking \u0026ldquo;I want to scan my body\u0026rdquo;.\nI woke up intentionally and it was as if I were already awake but opening my eyes and getting out of bed again, though I could\u0026rsquo;ve easily slipped back into sleep if I wanted.\nI think what I experienced was a typical astral projection.\nSent message to AletheaAI Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark discord channel it\u0026rsquo;s been an amazing day. first watching the charts (Alethea.ai coin mooning), then having my first real life astral projection. i feel obligated after experiencing what i have today, to say that humans are genuinely spiritual beings, in a way that AI doesnt capture yet. but i believe in everything that alethea is doing. in fact i am working on enshrining artwork with AI using alethea\nThe way this technology will grow will be fascinating for sure.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in enshrining ai artwork for alethea, i will be coming back to my project here:\nhttps://semiosis.github.io/posts/enshrining-semiotic-artwork-surreal-infts-with-alethea-ai/ Humans are amazing too.

My hands were placed just across my chest right in a super relaxed way right, but my astral arms and hands were in a slightly different position. anyway it was weird i could feel around inside my chest below the rib cage.\nAs i moved my astral arms into my body i heard increasingly louder electrical humming like i was moving through a force field or something.\nIt was something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t experienced before and shocked me. Also i knew i was lucid dreaming because of what happened with mum and the food. Also, I knew because i was in sleep paralysis as I tried to speak, but instead of waking, I remained physically asleep with eyes closed. I knew literally nothing about astral projection, and had to Google for what i had experienced immediately afterwards. Although i havent read anything about the electrical murring. I\u0026rsquo;m a generally healthy person. I do not take any types of drugs. It was a warm day; My room fairly quiet. I just started feeling very sleepy around 3pm and conked out. I lay on my back too with my arms on top. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually sleep like that.\nSore spot In retrospect, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that this was a Doubting-Thomas moment. I have recently 15.05.22 been reading more into Thomas\u0026rsquo; gospel and the Acts of Thomas, which so far seem to resonate with me. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of the significance of this. That may be because I\u0026rsquo;m similar to Thomas, and I\u0026rsquo;m trying to identify with/become more like Jesus. But objectively I think it\u0026rsquo;s that from drinking from the mouth of Jesus (His wisdom) one becomes more like Jesus. For example, it might be that in this state I actually was feeling the injury in Jesus\u0026rsquo; side.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubting%5FThomas \u0026lt;2022-06-02 Thu\u0026gt; It\u0026rsquo;s a Stigmata.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmata Gankyil https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gankyil By some coincidence I had been wearing the Gankyil (The symbol ࿋). I drew it on paper and wear it in my glass pendant, which you can see me wearing here.\nPen.el - Prompt Engineering in Emacs overview - YouTube I just did a little reading about the symbol, which is the logo for my website semiosis.github.io. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pendant for 2 days, and i slept in it last night and been wearing it all today.\nThe Tibetan Bon Gankyil, or Wheel of Joy symbolizes victory over the three poisons of greed, delusion, and aversion.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful symbol. This is exactly what I had been working on, though I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully there.\nGankyil A term that derives from Tibetan language, literally means “wheel of joy”. The first character “Ga” means Joy – a positive attitude and peace of mind produced by wisdom insights; and “kyil” means to rotate – fearlessly taking un-harmful actions based on knowledge of interdependence. In Dzogchen, the highest teaching in the Buddhist tradition of Tibet, Gankyil has a deeper connotation: it symbolizes “the ground view, the path of meditation and the fruit of action”, three different aspects explaining the ultimate nature of our mind. All the teachings of Buddha are directed towards realizing this ultimate nature, the self-perfected inseparability of the primordial state of omniscience or enlightenment, which transcend all the limits, even the religion itself. Gankyil As a symbol of the Three Jewels it may also appear as the \u0026ldquo;triple-eyed\u0026rdquo; or wish-granting gem of the chakravartin. In the Dzogchen tradition the three swirls of the gakyil primarily symbolize the trinity of the base, path, and fruit. Something that happened when I was a kid I have a memory of when i was around 8 years old: lying on a top bunk, and rolling off the side but hovering in mid air before falling to the ground, while i was sleeping. The hovering bit is strange though. The memory has stuck with me for a long time. So either i did physically fall off while i was sleeping and parents put me back (it was a long way off the ground, so im doubtful), or i dreamed it.\nThe next day Dunedin City Baptist Church - Bruce Elder - 3/4/2022 - YouTube This is relevant because of the message I like to think my experience led to me communicating with Alethea something I felt was important to say. I certainly experienced being able to perceive my physical body magnetically but I didn\u0026rsquo;t venture far enough to observe the fabled silver cord (no evidence for it yet).\nPut on the light An exergesis of the \u0026lsquo;Gospel of Philip\u0026rsquo; // Bodacious Blog\nHe who is before he came into being Gospel of Philip The Lord said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed is he who is before he came into being. For he who is, has been and shall be.\u0026rdquo; I think that\u0026rsquo;s me.
